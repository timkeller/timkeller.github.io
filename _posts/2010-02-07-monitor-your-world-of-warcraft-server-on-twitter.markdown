Its no secret that I spend a fair amount of my time in [World of Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com). My main character, a Human Paladin, is on the US-based realm of Stormscale.

In order to support the 12 million players, Blizzard operates a network of 500+ servers (called Realms) across the globe. From time to time, these realms are taken offline for maintenance or upgrades by the Blizzard Tech staff. This post is about how to track these periods of downtime so that players can easily monitor the status of their realm.



	
  1. Start by visiting [http://warcraftupdate.net/](http://warcraftupdate.net/) - a directory of all the US-based realms.

	
  2. Search for your realm, and click on the title once found.

	
  3. This will link you to your Realm's Twitter profile (such as the one for my realm, [Stormscale](http://twitter.com/stormscale)).

	
  4. Follow the profile in order to receive updates whenever your realm goes up or down.


For the alliance,
Tim
