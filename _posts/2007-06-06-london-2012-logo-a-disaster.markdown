A lot of things in this world have become "cheapened" over the past hundred years, but the Olympics symbol has remained clear, elegant and professional despite changing and modernising theories of design.

You can imagine my shock when I found London's absolutely disgusting attempt at a youth-relevant, internet-trendy, modern-day-ready logo for their 2012 games. Above is the logo which has been accepted and published on the official site at [www.london2012.com](http://www.london2012.com).
Oh, and by the way, London paid the logo designer a cool Â£400 000 to create this monstrosity.

I know... I was surprised as well... because it looks as if it was drawn by the Head of the Olympics two-year-old daughter!

Flip London, you can do better than this.
