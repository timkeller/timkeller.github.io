[](http://timk.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/ETCx-Elkanah-Logo.png)It's just two weeks to go until EdTechConf Extended at Elkanah House.

Earlier this year we held the [inaugural EdTechConf](http://timk.co.za/2011/03/23/edtechconf2011/) at the International School of Cape Town. 120 teachers, principals and ICT managers gathered together to learn and share best practices for implementing educational technology in teaching and learning.

**Dates: **Friday 30 September (8am to 5pm) and Saturday 1 October (8am to 3pm)
** Venue:** Elkanah House ([85 Sunningdale Drive, Sunningdale](http://maps.google.co.za/maps?q=85+Sunningdale+Drive,+Sunningdale&hl=en&sll=-28.45,24.7&sspn=24.514755,46.538086&vpsrc=0&t=h&z=16))

Space is limited but registration is still open for a few more days. [Register now](https://adobeformscentral.com/?f=ICVEX01l6XZboo4vdZ95Xw) and avoid disappointment!

My colleagues at [Umoya Networks](http://www.umoya.net) will be providing free wifi to every delegate - so be sure to bring your laptops, iPads and phones so that you can "tweet along" with the conference proceedings.
