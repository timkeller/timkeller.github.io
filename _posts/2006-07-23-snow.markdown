For a few weeks almost every year, the Ceres area of the Western Cape experiences heavy Snow-fall and thousands of families from the otherwise snow-forsaken country flock to the area to build snowmen, throw snowballs, and consume large quantity's of alcohol (atleast, from what I gather).

Anyway - for the first time ever I was part of that crowd (well not the alcohol part) today! Amy, myself and her parents were up at 5am getting ready to leave by 6am and take the 2.5 hour trip to Ceres.

My dad has our Fuji digital still so I just had my Canon Digital Video and Amy's Olympus (a really nice camera I might add) to take footage. These three are now on DeviantArt:
