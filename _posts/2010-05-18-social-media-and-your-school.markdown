Social Media and Your School

Join [Umoya](http://www.umoya.net) Web developer, Tim Keller, and [Lanner House](http://www.lannerhouse.co.za) headmaster, [Arthur Preston](http://www.headthoughts.co.za), to find out how you can build an online professional learning network, promote your school using Social Media, rethink how your students submit work, and understand what all these buzzwords like Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, LinkedIn and Weebly actually mean to you.

South African Principals' Association, 19 May at 15:00, Norman Henshilwood High School.
