In late July I [spoke](http://www.timokeller.net/2006/07/31/microsoft-turns-2-d-pictures-into-3-d/) about Photosynth being released soon. Well, late last year it was! I've  been playing with it this evening and all I can say is WOW. It takes a huge collection of JPEGs, runs them through a system which works out how they relate to eachother, and the builds a 3D world based upon them. The interface is beautiful and the feeling of immersion is astounding. This is what technology should be about. It is ubdoubtably the coolest toy since Google Earth. You are missing out if you don't go play with this right now!
