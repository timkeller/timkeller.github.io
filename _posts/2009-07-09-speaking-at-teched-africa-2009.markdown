Developer Tools, Languages, and Frameworks

PHP is a wildly popular scripting language for the web, and powers some of the largest websites on the Internet. Traditionally, PHP on Windows has been something of an oxymoron. Join us and find out why PHP is now highly performant, scalable and efficient when run under FastCGI on Windows Server and IIS. Presented by a local PHP developer, you'll gain insight into how you can take advantage of PHP on Windows, and integrate it with technologies like PowerShell, [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) and SQLServer.

  2. **Embrace Open Source on CodePlex                                                 (DTL302)**
Developer Tools, Languages, and Frameworks** **

If you're a software developer interested in running an open source project or just looking around for a particular tool to download, come check out the latest from CodePlex. CodePlex is the open source project hosting site from Microsoft. Launched in May 2006, CodePlex hosts thousands of open source projects. CodePlex users can start open source projects with support for source control, bug tracking, wiki pages, downloads, forums, and project statistics. Additionally, CodePlex supports the widest range of source control clients. This talk explores the top downloaded projects, outlines the CodePlex feature set, and explains how we build the CodePlex software.


I'm looking forward to spending time with some great techologists. Let me know if you'll be attending!
