...makes Timmy a dull boy!
I cannot believe I went an entire day without a blog posting! Such is the nature of my week I'm afraid. I'm currently sitting in a horribly warm Shuttleworth Lab (I'm too lazy to walk to library to use my laptop), and typing up a quick post before I head of for an hour of maths studying so that Stats studying can take priority this afternoon (sigh).

On Tuesday afternoon (Mayday + 2) I was sitting in the Dentist's waiting room typing a nice blog post about how much I hate going to the dentist and how cool it was that I could blog from my phone... As I hit send for the second time (this first time i hit delete by mistake - lol) it took me to a page that said: Error! So, my stunning post disappeared into oblivion... never to be seen my anyone - a pity really. Anyway - the Dentist turned out to be ok: only one big hole and two liiiitle ones that need to be patched up next week or the next... just need some time to go.

Did lots of Stats studying yesterday afternoon and evening before going to see Amy. Today is one of the cram days where I go home and study until like 9 or 10pm :( Sigh... has to happen. The worst is that I will spend literally the ENTIRE weekend on the client (part 2) of the the ComSci project. Oh well...

Holidays start, 15 June!! *Counts down the days*
