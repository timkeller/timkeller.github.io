[![Chasing Friday](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4115/4957870959_eaba270450_z.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/timokeller/4957870959/)

I recently had the opportunity to [shoot some photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/timokeller/sets/72157624882247924/) of local band, **Chasing Friday**.

Despite only forming three years ago in Sept 2007, front-man Phill Black, Neil Broers, Gus Warden and Nico Mouissie, have already gathered local fame with their eclectic and quirky take on college rock. Their achievements already include their single, Campus Girl, being featured on the SL Magazine compilation, two of their music videos airing regularly on MNet and Mnet HD television, and winning the Cape Town leg of the RBF Battle of the Bands.
