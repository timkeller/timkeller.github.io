Well, looks like its a mere 4 days 'til Techâ€¢Ed kicks off in Durban. I'm putting the finishing touches on my two sessions and look forward to delivering them on Monday 3 August and Tuesday 4 August.





  * Windows Server and FastCGI Technologies for PHP


  * Embrace OpenSource on CodePlex


  * Whiteboard: Web Experience



I'll post the slides here on Tuesday evening, straight after the conference.
