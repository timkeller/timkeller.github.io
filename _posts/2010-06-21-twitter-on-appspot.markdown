This evening, while Googling for something unrelated, I came upon a Twitter status page. I clicked through and thought nothing of it. Later I came back to the tab and the URL caught my eye: http://7920074.appspot.com. What?!

Am I missing something, or is Twitter testing their web interface on Google AppEngine? I seriously doubt it... I guess this is just some hacked up transparent redirect to twitter.com?
