My girlfriend, Amy, has restarted her [Amyblog.net](http://amyblog.net) site after over a year of inactivity! So toddle over there and read what she has to say whenever you get the chance - should make interesting reading! She's busy studying for her Bachelors Degree in Education at the moment and will be teaching a class of Fourth Graders from January 2008 - which is fantastic because she can earn money while I finish my Bachelor of Science! :)
It seems I have inspired some level of geekage in her: she's running the latest Wordpress 2.3 whereas I'm more than a few builds behind still!

Nice to have you back online Amy!
