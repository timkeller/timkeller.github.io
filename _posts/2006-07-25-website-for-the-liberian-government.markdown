Through my work at Umoya Networks I have been tasked to develop the website and setup the email system for the Government of Liberia.

Liberia, officially the Republica of Liberia, is a country on the west coast of Africa, bordered by Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Côte d'Ivoire. Liberia, which means "Land of the Free", was founded as an independent nation by free-born and formerly enslaved people from the United States. Recently it has witnessed two civil wars, the Liberian Civil War (19891996), and the Second Liberian Civil War (19992003), that have displaced hundreds of thousands and destroyed its economy. --Wikipedia.

The process of registering a .lr domain for them is proving difficult as the single man who manages the .lr domains is, at best, impossible to work with and has been unhelpful every step of the way. Nevertheless we trust that God has his hands on the situation and it will be resolved shortly.

Here is an early mock-up of the front page. I've spent the last day and a half writing the PHP5/MySQL backend that will run the site. Pretty exciting :) Click thumbnail or larger image.
