Farewell! I'm off to Malaysia for two weeks. We fly at 11:30am tomorrow (friday) morning and will be back 12 July. Can't wait... it been two years since my last real holiday, and Amy & My first trip together (albei it with parentals) :)

I'll be posting as many photos as the Island Internet will allow.
