![Luke, Tim and Christiaan](http://timk.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/200910084436103.jpg)I was privileged to get to spend the day with some of the brightest entrepreneurs and founders in Cape Town at the Silicon Cape launch. It was incredible to see how quickly founders Vinny Lingham (of [Yola](http://www.yola.com)) and Justin Stanford (of 4Di Capital and [FireID](http://www.fireid.com/)) have been able to bring their vision of a Silicon Valley in the Cape to light. The event included big hitters like former Mail & Guardian Online GM [Matthew Buckland](http://www.matthewbuckland.com/), South African billionaire Johann Rupert, Western Cape Premier [Helen Zille](http://twitter.com/helenzille), and [Dr Ramphela Mamphela](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamphela_Ramphele).

The essence of the day can be consumed via [various](http://afrigator.com/link/url/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.matthewbuckland.com&return_url=http%3A%2F%2Fafrigator.com%2Fprofile%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.matthewbuckland.com) [news](http://www.timeslive.co.za/business/money/article147313.ece) [sources](http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=83691), but ultimately three goals were exposed:



	
  * To develop a digital innovation hub

	
  * To give entrepreneurs a kick-start

	
  * To set up a Cape VC fund for start-ups


The main take-away for me was an issue raised by a delegate during the open-floor panel discussion: we have a drastic skills-shortage in the local tech start-up space. While the Silicon Cape may foster a community of entrepreneurship, we can't do much without high quality, skilled employees. The majority of our bright minds are picking up corporate bursaries after High School, and moving straight into black suit and tie after 4 years at University. If we're going to have great startups in the Silicon Cape, we need great programmers, sysadmins and techies who are available for employment.

With that in mind, I'm going to kick off a little group around this. I think it should be called "Develo**php**ers Cape Town" - a community for PHP devs, aspiring and experienced. Let's see if we can get some discussion going in the comments here. What is needed most: training, social geek-out events, hackathons, etc?

It is clear to me, that the Cape is onto something really exciting and potentially powerful. Let's be a part of it.
