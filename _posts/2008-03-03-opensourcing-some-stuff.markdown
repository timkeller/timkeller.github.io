Hey all

It has - yet again - been ages since I've posted. Sorry to keep you *all* waiting!

We here at OneWebStudios have had great fun writing a lot of code over the past year, in various languages, and so today I'm pleased to announce that we're going to start opensourcing certain projects. This won't happen overnight, nor will it include our major projects (ChirpSchool, etc) but it will include smaller projects that we'd love some help with. If you're keen to join the OWS family, drop us a comment on this blog post.

In the meantime, watch [www.timokeller.net/opensource](http://www.timokeller.net/opensource) for news.

Tim
