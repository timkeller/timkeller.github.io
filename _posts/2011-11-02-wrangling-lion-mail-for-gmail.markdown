In light of Gmail's [awful](http://twitter.com/#!/timkeller/status/131501027697504256) [redesign](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/gmails-new-look.html) - I've decided to move back to Apple Mail (on Lion). Its a fantastic app, but it does need a fair bit of tweaking before its ready to replace the (old) Gmail web UI.

Here's what you'll want to do:



	
  * Read [Alan Hogan's](http://alanhogan.com/lion-mail-vs-sparrow) comparison of Sparrow and Lion Mail if you're still unsure about Mail.app.

	
  * Follow the [Jamie Talbot's](http://jamietalbot.com/2011/07/26/configuring-os-x-mail-for-gmail-without-duplicates/) setup guide for Lion mail

	
  * Setup a gmail-like priority inbox using [Erik Hansen's](http://classyllama.com/productivity/create-a-priority-inbox-in-mail-show-only-unread-and-flagged-messages/) great smart mailbox tutorial.
