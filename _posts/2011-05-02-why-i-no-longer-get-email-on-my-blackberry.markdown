After my [rant](http://timk.co.za/2011/04/22/special-knowledge-butterflies/) last week about constant partial attention, I tracked down the [research](http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/sep2007/ca20070920_461254.htm?campaign_id=rss_null) that sparked some of this thinking - a 2007 article by Hewlett in BusinessWeek.


> Researchers at Kings' College London University have found that, across the board, communication overload causes a professional's IQ to drop 10 percentage points. It damages a worker's performance by reducing mental sharpness. The drop in IQ is more significant among men than women.


I'm quite protective of what _IQ_ I have, and so I've embarked upon a mission to reduce the [push](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_email) inputs in my life.

I have two email accounts. A personal gmail, and a work Google Apps account. Previously, both were delivering email to my Blackberry. Now - thanks to a few simple filters in the BIS web interface - I only get important email from work colleagues who have my address in the_ To _field.

The same goes for Skype and IM in general. Gone. I'll turn Skype on when I need to record a podcast or hold a meeting.

The difference is amazing. For the last two years, I've begun my day by waking up, and scanning through the 20-odd emails that have arrived over night. By the time I've reached the office my inbox can contain 35 read (but [un-processed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)) emails. And then the day begins.

Hewlett goes on to report:


> IT consultant [Linda Stone](http://continuouspartialattention.jot.com/WikiHome) has shown how "continuous partial attention" can be seriously dysfunctional. When a professional is bombarded by multiple information streams it becomes hard to sustain focus. Innovation and creativity suffer—as does the quality of decision making.


In the post-knowledge era, we need employees who can think, decide, and execute consistently. They need the freedom to dig into a problem for long stretches of time in order to deliver quality output.

So, apparently men can't multitask. I tend to wonder if anyone should even be allowed to multitask?
