Adrian Marnewick writing at Teacher's Monthly:


> Yesterday I attended the EdTechConf Tablet Indaba hosted by the International School of Cape Town. This event was a thinkshop attended by various schools across the city that are currently leading the drive towards introducing mobile technology into schools.


A fantastic summary of the afternoon's discussion. A must-read.
