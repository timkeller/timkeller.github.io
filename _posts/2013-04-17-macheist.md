[MacHeist NanoBundle 3](http://macheist.com/) has eight excellent OSX apps on sale for just $9.99. 

I bought it for:

- **[Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical)** is an amazing calendar app that uses natural language to capture appointments.

- **[xScope](http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope)** is a tool for designers or developers. Ever needed to measure some on-screen objects? Reached for the ruler and held it up to the screen? You (and I) need xScope.

- **[Pathfinder](http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/)**[^1] is a Finder replacement that adds tabs, bookmarking, batch renaming, file tagging, and a whole lot more.

Bought individually, you'd be $260 out of pocket. $9.99 seems like a great deal.

[^1]: Pathfinder will be unlocked once enough people purchase the MacHeist bundle.
