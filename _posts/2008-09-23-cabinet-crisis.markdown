I'm gonna be blunt. Jacob Zuma is a bloody prick - and one who has probably just plunged our country into 10 years of political disaster.




Let's tally up who has resigned their position in accordance with President Thabo Mbeki's resignation yesterday (22 September):




1. Deputy President  
2. Minister of Defence  
3. Minister of Finance  
4. Minister in the Presidency, Dr. Essop Pahad  
5. Minister of Intelligence  
6. Minister of Correctional Services  
7. Minister of Public Enterprises  
8. Minister of Science and Technology  
9. Minister of Public Works  
10. Minister of Provincial and Local Government  
11. Minister of Public Service and Administration  
  
The following Deputy Ministers have also tendered their resignations:  
1. Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Aziz Pahad  
2. Deputy Minister of Finance and  
3. Deputy Minister of Correctional Services
