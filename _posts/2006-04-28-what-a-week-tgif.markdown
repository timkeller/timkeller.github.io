Thank goodness its friday! My gosh this has been an insane week!

The week started off badly because of last weekend, Friday night at stayed home to get a good chunk of my ComSci program done. That was marginally successful and got a bit done on it. On Saturday I did about 7 hours of straight programming on the server project and was beginning to see the light. Sunday mornin dawned and I did a little more ComSci (but not finished) before starting to study to revolting Applied Maths! Really... its just... bleh!
*hopes Dr Laurie doesn't read his blog*

Monday was a shockingly long day only ending at 4pm! I dashed home without seeing my girlfriend (sigh) and studied until 11pm. Tuesday arrived and the test was miserable, but mostly because of the phone call I got just before that. One of my top client's websites had just been hacked by a hacking group in Brazil. Ofcourse my concentration in the test was affected by this news! After the test I literally ran back to my car to go sort out the hacking issue. I spent an hour waiting around for the ISP to call me back with no avail. By 12pm I decided I simply *had* to get home and finish the project for the next day. As I got home David from the ISP phoned to tell me how it had happened.

A the hacker had exploited security vulnerability in the javascript menu system for the site and then used my php scripts to include the installation of a BitTorrent server. He had thus been running a full on BitTorrent mirror of my webspace for the past 5 days!

To my upset, fixing the website had to wait (David had taken it offline for me) until the project was done. And I began working furiously on the Battleships server. By 9pm I was still working and getting more and more sleepy. I eventually decided to call it a day - the project was only due for 5pm the next day (Wednesday)

So I woke up, dashed to varsity for Maths and then came back home to finish. The problem with large programs is that when you change something, you have to test and retest everything each time. But I managed to solve some major problems pretty quickly by the time lunch time came around and was impressed with my work.

Then it was the final push. I have never coded so fast in my life, testing and double testing each step of the code. EVENTUALLY with literally only 1 minute to go (4:59) I submitted the final server.

Phew.
