I'll post more on this tomorrow because its already 1:50am and I must go sleep so I think straight tomorrow! But surfice it to say I'd be nowhere if it weren't through the efforts of Max to rewrite the protocol spec for our ComSci projects. The "designer" as this anonymous person has been called basically just disappeared from the scene at the time we needed him/her most... sigh. Thanks Max!
