It is indeed a wonderful to be an Uru fan, well wonderful week! Sorry for the delay in blogging! I've been here and there and kinda busy everywhere. *ahem* Yes... Uru:

I think Cyan World's CEO Ryan Millar sums it up in his press release:





_An adventure is only an inconvenience rightly considered. An inconvenience is an adventure wrongly considered._




- G. K. Chesterton




Fellow fans and adventure seekers,




Uru has been quite an adventure for us. After pouring everything we had into our vision back in 2002, Uru Live was abruptly cancelled. There have been several fits and starts since then - various attempts to keep the vision alive. The most notable was Until Uru - a continuation of Uru Live that put its future directly into the hands of the fans. The fans didnt let us down.




Although the fans were able to bide their time in the ancient underground city and distant Ages, not much changed. There were huge expanses to explore and share, but the full vision of Uru Live was designed to be dynamic and changing - providing new story and places to explore all the time. Now, with some help from our forward thinking friends at Turner/GameTap, were pleased to announce that were ready to bring Uru Live back to life.




We have been furiously toiling behind the scenes to write some interesting new content that will make its way into Uru Live in the coming months. Weve also been working on the nuts and bolts - rebuilding our software and servers to clean up bugs and lag and to provide a base for cutting-edge improvements in the future.




This new adventure is not without caveats. Were smaller and leaner now. We have much more to do with fewer people to do it. But were trying to work smart to provide new content that provides fresh new adventure for everyone on a regular basis.




So here we go again into exciting unknown territory. Little did we know that the opening lines of Myst would be so prophetic.




Thanks so much for all of your encouragement and support,




Rand Miller
