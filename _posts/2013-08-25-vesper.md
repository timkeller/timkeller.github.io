## Vesper

I've been using this app for the past few months. This is my review. Like the visual brevity of Vesper's design, this review is short and to the point:

Vesper is not the best notes app in the App Store. But — much like the Moleskine notebook I carry everywhere — Vesper somehow brings the best ideas out of me. It's lack of features is its best feature.
