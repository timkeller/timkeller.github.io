[ Speech](http://home.datacomm.ch/rezamusic/chaplin_speech.html) by Charlie Chaplin in [The Great Dictator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Dictator)
Music by Hans Zimmer for [Inception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inception)


> Greed has poisoned men's souls; has barricaded the world with hate; has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.

Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge as made us cynical; our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity.

More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in man; cries out for universal brotherhood; for the unity of us all.
