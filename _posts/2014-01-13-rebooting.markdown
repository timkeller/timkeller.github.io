Most years I spend a couple of days in December planning for the year ahead. That process [usually](/2013/01/01/2012-in-review) results in a blog post detailing my broad goals and ideas for the year ahead. This year is a bit different.

After five years at Umoya and seven years working on Staffroom full-time, I've found myself facing a fresh start in a completely new job and in a totally different industry. I'm now working at [Sunrise Productions](http://sunrise.co.za) as a Senior Developer. 

Initially I'll be helping the CG Pipeline team with some tools development - specifically for [Maya](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-maya/overview) and [Houdini](http://www.sidefx.com). New, unknown, exciting. It's a massive change, but I must admit that my first week has been fantastic. Sometimes the most uncomfortable decision turns out to be the best decision.

So here's to the next chapter... 

<i>Update 2014-05-18: Staffroom was sold to [EiffleCorp](http://eiffelcorp.co.za) in April 2014.</i>
