Most years I spend a couple of days in December planning for the year ahead. That process [usually](/2013/01/01/2012-in-review) results in a blog post detailing my broad goals and ideas for the year ahead. This year is a bit different.

After five years at Umoya and seven years working on Staffroom full-time, I've found myself facing a fresh start in a completely new job and in a totally different industry. I'm now working at [Sunrise Productions](http://sunrise.co.za) as a Senior Developer. 

Initially I'll be helping the CG Pipeline team with some tools development - specifically for [Maya](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autodesk-maya/overview) and [Houdini](http://www.sidefx.com). New, unknown, exciting. It's a massive change, but I must admit that my first week has been fantastic. Sometimes the most uncomfortable decision turns out to be the best decision.

I'm still serving as an advisor team at Staffroom, and plan to do so for the foreseeable future. 

So here's to the next chapter...
