![](http://python.org/images/python-logo.gif)Calling budding programmers, developers and geeks!

Are you interested in learning computer programming? Want to find out what it is all about, without devoting too much time? Do you have a child or learner that might be interested? The [University of Cape Town](http://www.uct.ac.za) is holding a free course to give young learners an introduction to computer programming. They will teach the basic skills needed to start creating your very own fun and useful computer programs.

The course will be run from **Friday 26 to Sunday 28 February 2010**. It is targeted at learners in **grades 7â€“10** with little or no knowledge of programming, but learners of other grades are also welcome. The course will teach [Python](http://www.python.org): a real-world programming language used by many large companies such as Google, Yahoo and Industrial Light & Magic that is also easy to pick up.

The only prerequisite for the course is a fair level of computer literacy: using a web browser and text editor. The course will start from the very basics of what computer programming is about and end off with an introduction to programming concepts: flow control, lists and functions.

You can apply online at [http://algorithm.cs.uct.ac.za/apply](http://algorithm.cs.uct.ac.za/apply). Dead- line for applications is 21 February.

Using computers is an unavoidable part of everyday life. In almost every profession you need to use them and even at home. You will find your children using them at a young age. It is important that your child gets to grip various bits of software and programming so that when they get older they will not be fazed by things like [broadband from O2](http://www.o2.co.uk/broadband/) or other more complicated computer programs.

As this course is designed with children in mind, it really is the best place for your child to come. It is taught in a manner that children will be able to pick up quickly and also enjoy. Children shouldn't feel intimidated by technology and this will really help them with a step in the right direction feeling at ease with it.
