> “Hello, Windows 8? This is iPad. You win.”


That's [Paul Thurott](http://twitter.com/#!/thurrott/status/113678795956948993) tweeting from //Build/ (yes, the forward slashes _are_ required) where a developer preview for Windows 8 was released this week. You can almost feel the simultaneous relief and collective glee of the Windows community as their mainstream OS becomes cool again.

Apparently the above was actually [tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/thurrott/status/114015613747347459) in jest:


> Made a joke yesterday. Here's what I really think. iPad, Win8 tablets, and Amazon tablet will all own some part of this market. Obviously.


Interesting choice: iPad, Win8, and Amazon tablets. Notice how only one of those devices actually exists in the market? The Amazon tablet remains a rumour and, while there is no official release date, it seems like Windows 8 is only slated for a September 2012 release. Yes, that's a year from now. _A year._

Microsoft struck gold with DOS, Office and Windows in the late eighties and [dominated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft) the consumer technology space in the nineties. By surveying what competitors were releasing and responding rapidly with a commodity solution, they were able to monopolise the industry.

But their game plan hasn't changed ever since. They've applied the same basic strategy to every innovation that has popped up on their radar. Sometimes this has found [disastrous results](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_technical_problems), while in general they've just been so [late](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune) to the game that their imitation is outdated by the time it reaches market.

So let's consider some innovations (in this case by Apple) and the number of days it took Microsoft to imitate them and bring a product to market:

  * 1984 Macintosh (GUI) to Windows 3: _2995 days_

	
  * 2001 iPod to Zune: _1848 days_

	
  * 2007 iPhone to Windows Phone 7 Series System Series Seven: _1228 days_

	
  * 2008 MacBookAir to Windows on Ultrabooks: _1339 days_
(not strictly a Microsoft imitation here - more-so Intel trying to prop up Microsoft's business in an attempt to ward off ARM)

	
  * 2010 iPad to Windows 8 Tablets (assuming a Sept 2012 release): _882 days_


Put simply: Microsoft has accelerated their rate of imitation to meet changing industry demands, and this has become the sole-focus of the corporation. When last did something industry-changing came out of Redmond?

Remember how, until recently, a _certain_ tablet manufacturer literally had people [queuing](http://www.tuaw.com/2011/03/30/ipad-2-lines-persist-two-weeks-after-launch/) through the night for a chance to buy one? You can bet that's going to happen again early next year when the third generation device is released.

So, bravo Microsoft on building (sorry, //building/) what seems to be an impressive new entry into the touch OS arena. However, being a year away from having anything comparable to today's industry champion is just not reason to announce victory.
