Stick with me on this one…

This morning Amy and I spent some time chatting to an awesome couple outside of the Atlantis Traffic Department for Amy’s examiner to appear and start her test. We chatted about the K53 driving test, cars, work, politics, and the such. Light, happy, small-talk.

A small snag (which I’ll discuss in a later post) occurred and we had to quickly rush off. Obviously upon our return they were long since gone and our admitedly weak social relationship with the couple will probably never be reinstated.

This got me thinking about how Social Networks (think Facebook, MySpace and the internet at large) have affected our view of real-world, real-life, friendship. We’re so used to clicking “Add as Friend” when meeting any new person online that perhaps we have disabled ourselves from making true friendships in the real-world. We’re also so used to clicking through a new friend’s profile to see who they are friends with, and thereby determine how they fit into our social net. How then do we perform that same task in the real world?

Indeed, is it even possible to _have_ real friends without an online consummation of one’s friendship being instated? Or have we reached the point were we’re porting all of our friendships over to the online world? I look at most of the students I teach - they literally live on MXit (a hugely popular local IM client for Java phones), Facebook, and online games.

I propose that we are breeding a youth that have no idea how to maintain long, true, committed relationships (friendships plutonic or otherwise) in the real world.

How then do we cope with this change in the way our youth make friends? How do we as teachers put measures in place to handle this change? Do we accept it, mould it, or reject it.
