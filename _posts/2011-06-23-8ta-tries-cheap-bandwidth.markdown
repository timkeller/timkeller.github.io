Duncan McLeod [reports](http://www.techcentral.co.za/8ta-drops-broadband-bomb-on-rivals/24021/) on TechCentral


> Telkom’s new mobile operator, 8ta, has dropped a bomb on rivals Vodacom, MTN and Cell C, introducing a cut-rate broadband product offering 10GB of data a month for R199 on a 24-month contract.


Sure, but it's all about coverage - and 3G/HSPA coverage at that. And I can not believe that 8ta has a well built-out 3G/HSPA network. I could be wrong.

2G/EDGE is effectively untenable as an access method for today's internet.  Most web applications (Gmail, Facebook, etc.) are simply too large, asynchronous and realtime to be usable over a bad EDGE connection.

I've got a Cell-C speedstick. Apparently it can manage 21Mbps but I've never seen anything near that speed. What I have seen is poor quality, intermittent connections, and a drop to 2G/EDGE as soon as I leave city-bounds. Even within Cape Town CBD, there are plenty of dead patches.

I expect that Vodacom and MTN's bandwidth pricing will eventually be driven downwards by 8ta and Cell-C. In the meantime, I'm happy to pay a little more for reliability and quality.
