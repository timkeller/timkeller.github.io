[Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2011/11/13/google-reader-redesign-terrible-decision) on the awful Google Reader redesign:


> Google’s current “bet everything on social now because we missed the boat” movement feels a lot like Microsoft’s “bet everything on the internet because we missed the boat” movement in 1997. Remember how they wedged all sorts of internet-like functions into Windows 98, like Channels and Active Desktop? Those worked well and made Windows better, right?


Yeah... that worked out great.

Throwing the baby out with the bath-water for the sake of "progress" and continued "relevance" is usually a recipe for disaster. Google wants Facebook's mind-share, and they're pivoting (poorly) every product in attempt to do so. This is a mistake.

Innovate on your competencies. Don't innovate via imitation.
