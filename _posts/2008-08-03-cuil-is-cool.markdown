Its been an interesting week for Search. Cuil has launched and positioned itself the google-killer we've all been waiting for, Microsoft has refreshed their Live.com search page, and Google has… well… just kept doing what they've done for the last 10 years.




Cuil claims to index more of the web, present it better, and use a more efficient ranking algorithm. Google uses_ Pagerank_ - or, "degree of popularity on the interwebs". Thus, you always get the page which is most linked-to from other pages on the web.




But just because something is popular doesn't neccesarily mean it's the best. To paraphrase the Cuil guys: "No body is calling your grandmother. But when you're looking for her number, you want it. Popularity is not always better".




I've been using Cuil for the past week and am truly very impressed. Here's what I like:




**Black background on the homepage**  
Attractive, gentle, neat.

**Auto suggest  
**Simple but effective ajax look-ahead searching.

**Magazine style presentation**   
Cuil presents results in a three column screen. Takes some getting used to, but is much more explorable than Google-style one-column results.

**Simplicity **  
The interface is really stripped down - the way Google used to be. There's no "Sign in with your Cuil account" or anything - awesome. I love that the top searchbar stays at the top of the page as you scroll through the results.

**Explore by category.**   
You can drill down into closely related searches with the click of a button. And what's more - the related categories are actually relevant!

I've added it to my Firefox and look forward to trying to use it for the next few weeks! Let's hope the experience remains so good.
