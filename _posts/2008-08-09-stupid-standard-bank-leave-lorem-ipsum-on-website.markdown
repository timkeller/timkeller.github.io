Those who have ever done any graphics/design/web work will be famililar with Lorem Ipsum. It's simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.




Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.




It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.




Anyway - the great Standard Bank of South Africa obviously had some over-zealous web designer knock together a quick website for their upcoming Jazz festival and managed (wait for it)â€¦ to leave some Lorem Ipsum on the registration page!




You can find it [here](http://www.standardbankjazz.co.za/JOJ/stayinformed/default.asp) until they realise :)

Update: They saw my Twitter message and blog post - and are apparently correcting it. The page is currently down.
