Greetings! Finally, a place for me to blog my mind that isn't owned by Microsoft, Google, Yahoo or some other previously small and nice company. For the techies interested (note I do not say geeks/nerds) I'm hosting this domain through my onewebstudios.com domain as an add-on domain. Its powered by that super funky and ultra sexy Wordpress.

I've had so many blogs over the past year that I honestly dont know how best to start what will hopefully be a long standing and somewhat interesting one. There are so many different facets of my life: there's technology news, university, social life, girlfriend, myst and uru, the cavern today, etc ... the list goes on and on and on. I'm just going to speak my mind here. It may sometimes be odd, it may sometimes go without being read for weeks on end. Nevertheless, I do want to maintain a blog... lets see how it goes!

Comment, complain, whatever :)
