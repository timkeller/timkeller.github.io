Phew what a day. Its midnight and I've just wrapped the SAPA DVD for Wednesday's presentation in Bloemfontein (it has to be delivered first thing tomorrow morning).




The Statistics test turned out to be okay. Not too hard, but not completely simple. Sorta average where a test should be I guess. Sleepy now. Wow. Good night.




Ps. Amy has Sinusitis and is on tons of meds... feeling quite (very) sick still so do keep her in your prayers if you wouldn't mind. Thanky.
