Hmmm its sometimes pretty hard to come up with a decent title for a blog post... Especially when you don't really have anything deep to talk about. Well I've always got things to talk about but sometimes its hard to completely put down everything you would like to... mostly acredited to being just sleepy after a really nice day.

On Saturday evening I got to do something really really cool which I'm not able to post about yet but will be around 5 July (I hope) - was great! What an experience.

Last night I went over to Amy's to enjoy a braai with Eva, Dave and the kids. They're down from Dubai for Eva to give birth to their third child in late August. Her children are just so cool. Ivar has grown up lots and is looking as smart, confident and cool as usual and Tom-Tom is looking as cute, bright and interested as he was when I saw him 6 months ago. I took a bunch of photos of him that i'll be 'tarting (sorry, amy and my term for devianT ART) later this eve or tomo morn. I hope to see more of 'em while they're down.

Today was pretty much the first of my holiday. Yeah I've been away from University for a good while now but I've been working at Umoya.net and the such so much that I havent had a moment to fully relax. So waking up at about 9:30 I dodged my sick dad for fear of catching whatever he has and went to fetch amy. We finally got to the bank to sort out my new Student bank account thing before buying me a new pillow... I've been sleeping on the same pillows for longer than i'm willing to admit and frankly: my neck is tired of it!

I've been meaning to set up a proxy server here at home for a while so I finally got around to it today. Squid was simple, as was the dhcpd server... the issue was, and still is, the firewall rules... I can't seem to get Transparent Firewalling working... Anyone who can help me with this will find great favour in my eyes. Hehe.

Tomorrow I have to go do the Dentist thing... hmmm shmeh... doing work on my front teeth which is a tad annoying because I'll get to walk around with a really fat lip for 2 hours! Oh well!

Cheers!
