A few... well... 14 of us headed to [Ratanga Junction](http://www.ratanga.co.za) Theme Park just outside Cape Town today. Posted below is the photo of us going down Crocodile Gorge - most fun. My darling amy decided to learn forward to avoid the drenching waterfall only to have her lower half soaked by the larger-than-expected stream of water gushing down the rocks.
