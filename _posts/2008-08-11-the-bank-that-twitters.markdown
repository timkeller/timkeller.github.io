Over the weekend I [posted](http://tumble.timokeller.net/post/45348358/stupid-standard-bank-leave-lorem-ipsum-on-website) about how Standard Bank had left some [Lorem Ipsum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) on the signup page for thei Jazz festival. Admittedly calling them "stupid" was just rude - indeed as a web designer I too have made silly mistakes from time to time.




What brought about my change of heart on this subject was the following: This morning I logged on and discovered a random new Twitter [follower](http://twitter.com/SnowgooseSA) - someone from Standard Bank! A few hours later, a message thanking me for picking up on the error arrived. Turns out Heidi (SnowgooseSA) is no less than the Online Marketing Co-ordinator at Standard Bank, South Africa.




It's so very impressive to see a traditional bank like Standard Bank making good use of current Web 2.0 tools to reach their audience. It is this kind of grassroots interaction that has secured many large corporations the love and admiration of geeks around the world. Good on them!
