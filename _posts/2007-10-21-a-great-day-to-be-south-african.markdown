![Rugby Victory 2007](http://timk.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/550-rugby.jpg)

This morning we woke up to a new world. A world strangely similar to late 1995 when the Springboks beat New Zealand to win the William Webb Ellis cup for the first time.

Last night we watched as Thabo Mbeki and captain John Smit held the cup up high in victory against the clearly inferior English side.

Go bokke!
