The mention of "PHP on Windows" to a developer is most commonly met with polite but pointed laughter, if not outright disgust. Historically, this reaction wouldn't be entirely inappropriate. But that has all changed with the advent of Internet Information Services (IIS) 7 and its FastCGI handler.

Coming from a Linux background, I was skeptical about running our mission-critical apps on Windows. We had a lot of infrastructure built around the traditional LAMP stack, and the mention of throwing Windows IIS in its place was somewhat shocking. But, I can tell you that the transition to IIS7 is utterly painless, and brought with it some incredible advantages.

For the first time, we're able to easily integrate our PHP products with ASP.NET code. We can build Rich Internet Applications with ASP.NET AJAX on the frontend and PHP on the backend. Even Silverlight 2.0 applications can be enhanced with familar PHP code to create something of value.

At DevDays 2009, which kicks off in Durban on the 10th of March, I'm going to be showing developers just how great it is to develop and deploy PHP applications on the Windows platform. Be there, or be [PEAR](http://pear.php.net/) :)
