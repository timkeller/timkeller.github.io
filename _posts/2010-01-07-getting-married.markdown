**19 December 2009: Tim and Amy get married at Simon's Town Methodist Church**

Our official [photographer](http://www.picturess.co.za/) will be turning in her beautiful images this week, but in the meantime I thought I should get just a couple of pics from the day up! Thanks to our family and friends for capturing some truly special memories for us.

First and foremost, thank you to all our friends and family who joined us on the 19th. Your presence and presents were most appreciated!

Getting married is just about the most exciting, scary, complicated and wonderful event you'll ever experience. The sheer number of things which need to come together on the day is quite astounding. Invites, guest list, seating plan, dress, suits, flowers, cars, pastor, mariage contract, marriage counseling, traveling friends/family, Honeymoon booking, speeches, lunch/dinner, cake, photographer, videographer, and rings - its all quite something.

As part of my commitment to [Project52](http://project52.info/) - to blog once a week for the next 52 weeks - I'll slowly be taking apart our _Year 2009_ and explaining how we were able to put together an amazing wedding without breaking the bank. From Engagement to Honeymoon, [Amy](http://twitter.com/amykeller) and I will share via this [category](http://timk.co.za/category/marriage/) of posts the steps you can take to put together a beautiful wedding experience of your own.

Happy New Year and welcome to 2010.
