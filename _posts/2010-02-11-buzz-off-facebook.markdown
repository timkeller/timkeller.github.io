In contrast to a week [allegations](http://brainstormtech.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2010/02/04/dick-brass-why-microsoft-is-failing/) of "internecine warfare among Microsoft's established divisions and a dysfunctional corporate culture that squashes innovation" comes _yet-another-innovative-Google-product_, [Google Buzz](http://www.google.com/buzz).  Google Buzz is Mountain View's first convincing entry into Social Networking, that isn't limited to merely an API.

Gina Trappani, posting on [Smarterware](http://smarterware.org/), says it all: "This ain't no [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com).". Google are very serious about taking down Twitter and Facebook.

Jason Calacanis, [posting](http://calacanis.com/2010/02/10/breaking-google-buzz-is-brilliant-facebook-just-lost-half-its-value/) to his email list this morning, made it clear that he sees this as a major challenge to facebook:


> 1. Google Buzz 1.0 is better than Facebook after six or seven years.

2. Facebook's history is one filled with stealing other people's
innovations and doing them better (i.e. Zuckerberg has stolen every
idea Evan Williams and the Twitter team have released). How ironic now
that Google has out "Facebooked" Facebook. Google

3. Google has excellent privacy record and Facebook is a disaster.
Most folks do not trust Zuckerberg and Facebook any more because of
their privacy record (filled with lawsuits) and because they steal
every good idea they see (i.e. Twitter's innovations and FourSquare's
checking in).

4. Google Buzz auto generates your network--this is MUCH better
process than Facebook's.

5. Google Buzz is way faster than the sluggish Facebook--this is a
HUGE advantage.

6. Google Buzz puts relies and updates into your GMAIL as
threads--this is BRILLIANT and a HUGE advantage.

The only problem, in the words of the imitable [Reinhardt Zündorf](http://www.google.com/profiles/110322743153515261271), is: "This is lame, now I can't find out  which dog I am (via a five bullet questionnaire) and share it with my  facebook friends".
