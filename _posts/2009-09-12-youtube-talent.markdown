I recall the first time I came across YouTube in 2005. [Ryan Warzecha](http://www.ryanwarzecha.com) suggested we at The (then highly active) [Cavern Today](http://www.thecaverntoday.org) put our video content onto a new website called "YouTube". My immediate reaction was somewhat negative. I assumed it was nothing more than a collection of barely funny memes, myspace-crazed teens, and keyboard cats. And, importantly, it was really slow on my 56k Dialup internet connection.

Fast forward to 2009 and I can easily lose an hour an evening on YouTube. In fact, Amy and I spent more than a few minutes this evening watching some _very _talented Yale students' music videos. Amazing.

The talent of some YouTube posters is absolutely astounding... and most of them are in High School or College. When I was in school (not terribly long ago), Tech-savvy meant knowing some Python or Java, running Firefox version 0.7, and hacking Linux on the weekends. Today, the tech-savvy youth are producing amazing creative work through simple (often free) audio and video editing apps on Macs, PCs and the web. It is hard not to be impressed.

Here's a couple of embedded videos from a YouTube-exclusive series produced by a bunch of Yale students. I think they deserve a watch. Enjoy!
