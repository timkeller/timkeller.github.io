Hello hello!

So here's something worth admitting: I've been running Wordpress 2.0 since 2006 and have never once bothered to upgrade to the latest version - unlike [Jonathan](http://www.espresso-online.info/) who seems to update to the current stable almost daily! So without further ado, let me welcome you to the new Wordpress2.5'd **timokeller.net 2.0**. I designed this rather simple theme to run on the effortlessly awesome [K2 theme](http://getk2.com) for wordpress, and I think its come out okay. Suggestions?

Congrats to the Wordpress guys on a stunning new WP-ADMIN panel and the already [huge number](http://wordpress.org/download/counter/) of downloads they have received. Its funny how even though its just a blogging script, it gets much more attention than [Drupal](http://drupal.org) releasing 6.1!

I've spent most of the past four months working on ChirpFX, a simple MVC Framework for developing human-centric web applications in [PHP](http://www.php.net) 5. The first application to use the framework is ChirpSchool - a highly extensible webapp for school and student management, assessment, promotion and monitoring. Its been picked up by the likes of [Sun Valley Primary School](http://svps.co.za) and other local schools, and we're looking forward to expanding at a rather exciting pace. We'll have a promo website up soon with more information. More on that in the coming weeks.

If you want to keep an eye on me, follow me on Twitter. If you're not on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/timkeller) yet I'd highly suggest you [join](https://twitter.com/signup) - its a really interesting way to interact with friends and followers!

Schedule for the next few weeks:



	
  * Cognitive Behaviour Analysis Tutorial Assignment and Project

	
  * Computer Science Network Architecture Tutorial 2 and Test

	
  * Professional Communication Unit Paper due

	
  * Deliver SMS and Assessment Modules of ChirpSchool

	
  * See lots of Amy!


Thanks for catching up! See you on Twitter.

Tim
