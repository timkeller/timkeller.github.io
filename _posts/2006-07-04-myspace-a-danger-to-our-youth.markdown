Last night I posted a blog about how disgusted I was with the way MySpace had been designed and presented. This morning I received an email from the site asking me to confirm my registration, which I promptly clicked to do this. To my utter shock and horror a large and animated vertical advert (about 120x580) depicting what can only be discribed as pornographic. The abomination features the tag line: "Get laid tonight. Hot girls of all types".


How dare MySpace.com present advertisements of this nature on a public page that *will* be visible to youngsters? The pornographic industry is damaging our youth and MySpace.com appears happy to entertain the notion that as long as monetary revenue is gained the advert content is of little importance. Not only is pornographic presentation to minors illegal, it is dangerous. The largest number of Trojans and similar virus-like software orginate from the depths of the XXX community's websites. How can we let our children endulge in activities on this website when they will undoubtably be presented with content of this nature either through adverts or unscrupilous user's MySpace sites.


I have the image on my hard drive for reference. I have taken a screenshot of the site. Now I'm emailing MySpace.com with my critism. I believe we need to educate the internet about the dangers of a community like MySpace. I believe 80% of the people joining the site are doing so because they want to see their friends photographs (that can only be seen once logged in) and are not properly aware of the dangers.

Playboy magazine even went so far as to run a "Girls of MySpace" competition to pick out the hotest of the MySpace lot. I'm sorry, this sinks so low I fail to find the words to express my disgust. On a similar thought, the fact that 13, 14 and 15 year old girls are posting nude images of themselves on their MySpace in order to "get friends" is just revolting. What has happened to our society!?

But these dangers don't stop at the pornographic element of the community. It goes into real life assault and abuse. In fact The Statesman.com ([link](http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/06/20myspace.html)) reports:


> A 14-year-old Travis County girl who said she was sexually assaulted by a Buda man she met on MySpace.com sued the popular social networking site Monday for $30 million, claiming that it fails to protect minors from adult sexual predators.


And goes on to say:


> "MySpace is more concerned about making money than protecting children online," said Adam Loewy, who is representing the girl and her mother in the lawsuit against MySpace, parent company News Corp. and Pete Solis, the 19-year-old accused of sexually assaulting the girl.


This is the crux of the matter. Stop the insanity. Stop MySpace.com.
