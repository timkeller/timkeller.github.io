It was August 2005 and I bunch of us had gathered on someone's Relto in [Until Uru](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst_Online:_Uru_Live). The topic of the night was how we should go about starting a podcast for the Myst/Uru Community. Back then, the idea of a podcast was a little more foreign than today, and plenty of time was spent arguing about what the hand-crafted RSS feed should contain.

Fast forward almost 5 years and The Cavern Today, spurred on by the return of Myst:Online Uru Live (again), has decided to "reboot" and start at Episode #1 again after months of non-production. Have a listen to our latest episode entitled, [Something Old, Something New](http://www.thecaverntoday.com/tct/267).

My role since the beginning has been to looking after the servers, forum software, and website. this February, I began a major redesign of the website using Wordpress.

Initially, I was sceptical of Wordpress' applicability to podcasting, but I was soon proven wrong. With the addition of a couple of simple plugins and a good theme, Wordpress can be a podcasting powerhouse!

A couple of tips for using Wordpress to podcast:



	
  * Create and use categories from the beginning. In this way you'll be able to publish multiple feeds, and therefore, multiple shows.

	
  * Choose/Build a simple theme which shows off your content, gives the visitor easy access to an MP3 download, and offers an iTunes Subscribe button.

	
  * Get a plugin to take away the audio-file management headaches. We use [Blubrry PowerPress](http://www.blubrry.com/powerpress/).

	
  * Choose one of the many Twitter plugins for Wordpress to auto-tweet when you publish a new episode.

	
  * Allow comments! The whole point of podcasting is to build and serve a community. Allowing comments means instant two-way communication with your community.


Happy podcasting!
