![Skype iPhone needs Wifi](http://timk.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/6a00d8341c5bcf53ef0120a63cb278970c.png)It [sounds like](http://hittingthewire.co.za/2009/10/are-vodacom-blocking-voip.html) Dave Gale had a bad day with his iPhone 3G and Vodacom today.


> I'm on the road today, between a client site [[that's us](http://www.umoya.net)] in Westlake and the home office when I discover that Vodacom have decided I don't need to talk to anyone. I call my wife 3 times in a row to hear her repeating "HELLO?" in more and more exasperated tones while I bellow fruitlessly into my headset, then rip the headset out of the phone just in case it is on the fritz, not the network. Nada. No joy.

So I think, no problem, I have Skype and Fring on this pocket rocket-phone, I'll just call via Skype-Out.


Not so much.

The iPhone SDK restricts apps from using the GSM network to make VoIP calls. The user has to have a Wifi connection via which these VoIP calls can be switched.

[Dave](http://www.twitter.com/d4v3g) continues (with links added by me):


> They charge us far more than they [should](http://mybroadband.co.za/news/Cellular/9960.html) for calls, [duck](http://www.mg.co.za/article/2009-10-13-vodacom-cellphone-fees-cut-may-disrupt-sa-economy) and [dive](http://mybroadband.co.za/news/Cellular/9641.html) when they're pressured to reduce prices, and then it appears they block us from making use of VoIP over 3G.


The tragedy is that this should not be a problem for South African iPhoners. It is AT&T/Apple policy that has shaped the App Store's T&Cs to protect the cellular network's traditional voice business interests. It is Apple's monopolistic [behaviour](http://www.maclife.com/article/news/apples_fcc_response_infuriates_google_voice_app_developer) that has landed the Cupertino-based powerhouse in hot water of the past.

But there seems to be some light in this iTunnel, according to [Engadget](http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2009/10/06/atandt-now-allowing-iphone-voip-calls-over-3g/) Mobile:


> AT&T's restrictive network policies might have been behind some of the [more notable iPhone app rejections](http://www.engadget.com/2009/08/21/atandt-tells-the-fcc-it-had-no-role-in-removing-google-voice-fro/) in the past, but at least one major class of applications just got the green light, as Ma Bell just opened up iPhone VoIP calls over 3G. We can only assume this is the result of the FCC's renewed push for [net neutrality](http://engadget.com/tag/netneutrality) and [AT&T's argument](http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/22/atandt-verizon-poised-to-fight-fccs-net-neutrality-stance-on-the/) that it's doesn't need new regulations to remain open, but -- what does this mean for you? Well, Skype on the road, for starters, but we're guessing a flood of interesting new VoIP apps will hit just as soon as devs can get their apps updated and submitted.


In the meantime, here's the [timk.co.za](http://www.timk.co.za/about) hacky work-around:



	
  1. Get yourself an old phone that has a Wifi chip in it (I use an old Nokia E65 with my iPod Touch when on the move)

	
  2. Download and Install [JoikuSpot Light](http://www.joiku.com/?action=products&mode=productDetails&product_id=310) - a free symbian app which turns your device into a Wifi Access Point to serve up the phone's 3G connection.

	
  3. Connect to the JoikuSpot from the iPhone's Wifi Manager.

	
  4. Make your Skype/Fring calls


Hope that helps! If it doesn't, you might be better off with one of [these](http://www.vodacomdirect.co.za/FindItFastHome.aspx?DealSheetNo=DV972002PA&utm_source=vodacomcoza&utm_medium=deal_banners&utm_content=ZTES305_TU49&utm_campaign=Handsets_Oct2009).
