It's an exciting day for Myst fans. The iPhone and iPod Touch version of the game was approved today and is available in the App Store.

Welcome back to Myst. Wherever you are

The original Myst sights and sounds have been meticulously re-assembled for a remarkable experience on the iPhone and iPod touch. Everything that you remember from the original Myst in a format where a simple touch or swipe moves you through the world.

That is, if you live in a first-world nation.

It is not currently available in the South African App Store, and thus I cannot bring you a real review at this time. I've emailed the Lead Developer and am hoping that he'll be able to get it into my local App Store.
