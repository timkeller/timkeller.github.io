When I was in High School I was quite the DeviantArt addict. I posted daily and received lots of accolades for my early photographic work, long before I got around to purchasing an awesome camera. Towards the end of the addiction to DA I posted two photographs of two surfers down at Kommetjie beach. They were my friends Chris B and Matt E, local Kommetjie guys.




The photos have become an absolute hit with 50+ favourites each and many positive comments over the years. I thought it perhaps worthwhile to post them here.
