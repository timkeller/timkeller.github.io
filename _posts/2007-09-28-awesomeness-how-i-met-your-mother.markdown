[![How I Met Your Mother Image 2](http://timk.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/himym21.png)](http://www.timokeller.net/2007/09/28/awesomeness-how-i-met-your-mother/how-i-met-your-mother-image-2/)
So I'd like to announce that I've just watched the best Sitcom/Dramedy (that's, er, a Dramatic Comedy) ever! It's a show that doesn't seem to have made it onto South African television (M-net nor the usually rubbish SABC channels) but was suggested to me by friend Alain... and it's LEGENDARY! If you've watched it please comment, if you haven't then you have gotta purchase the DVDs of [Season 1](http://www.amazon.com/How-Met-Your-Mother-Season/dp/B000HT3P7E/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2/104-0383657-0607120?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1190984086&sr=8-2) and [Season 2](http://www.amazon.com/How-Met-Your-Mother-Season/dp/B000TM1CKQ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-0383657-0607120?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1190984086&sr=8-1) from Amazon.com.

It's essentially a love story, told in reverse. A father is telling his two kids How, well, He Met [their] Mother in 2005 and all the up's and down's that went with that. Granted he actually hasn't yet met this elusive mother... but the story-telling is better than Sitcom-giants like Friends and Scrubs and the acting is fantastic. It is literally the only series I have ever watched whose use of flash-backs and time-shifting hasn't annoyed me beyond belief. It is so very, very clever.

I'm off to watch yet another episode. See it!
