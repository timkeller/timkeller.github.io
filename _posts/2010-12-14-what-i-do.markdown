![](http://timk.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Tim-Biopic-150x150.jpg)A lot of people ask me what exactly I do. I do a few of things... here's some of them:



	
  * [staffroom](http://www.mystaffroom.net) - school admin, assessment and management... done right, finally.

	
  * [uniti](http://www.umoya.net) - unified collaboration for teams, companies, government agencies and first responders.

	
  * [The Cavern Today](http://www.thecaverntoday.com) - a very geeky podcast about, well, geeky things.

	
  * [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/timokeller) - In my head, I'm a pro photographer. In reality, I'm still working on it.

	
  * [LastFM](http://last.fm/user/timomiles) - I love good music, good podcasts, and riveting audio-books.

	
  * [Twitter](http://twitter.com/timkeller) - Me in a 140 characters or less

	
  * World of Warcraft on [US](http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/stormscale/milesaunos/simple) and [EU](eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/stormrage/timias/simple) - Unproductivity at its best.


A follow-up post with more depth is in the works. Happy Holidays!
