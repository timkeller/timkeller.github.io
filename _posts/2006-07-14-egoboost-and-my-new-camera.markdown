Hey all,
My brother's class has to film and present a commercial for a made-up product of their choice when the return to school next week. There fake product is called EGOBOOST! So today Amy and I filmed Brad, Sam and Rob doing some of the strangest stuff I have ever seen. It was shot on my sexy new Canon MV890 Digital Video Cam. Its small, compact and has some really decent picture quality. [[Link](http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Camcorders/Digital/mv890/index.asp?ComponentID=341188&SourcePageID=231640)].

I edited the footage through the Firewire interface and capture within Pinnacle Studio SE 9.4. Its a really nifty interface and I enjoyed working with it. I'm frustrated by the locked functions that I need to purchase but I can live with out them for a little while. Overall, decent software with a very nice price tag.

I hope to show some of the footage soon :)
