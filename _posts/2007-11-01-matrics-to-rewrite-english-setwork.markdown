Matrics across the Western Cape will rewrite Paper 2 of the English Exam on November 23 said a spokesperson for the WCED this morning. This story courtesy of www.iol.co.za [[direct link to article](http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=105&art_id=nw20071031162944118C341022)]



> Western Cape matric students are to rewrite an English paper after it emerged that it was handed out in error in an earlier exam.

The province's education department said the English first language higher grade paper two would be rewritten on November 23.

It said the paper was mistakenly handed to some candidates at the South African College High School (SACS) on October 10, the day before the exam, and details of it had spread to other schools.

The department had terminated the contract of the chief invigilator at SACS and had issued a verbal warning to the head of the English department at the school. - Sapa



I'd like to state categorically that I think this is a pathetic waste of time. If 5% of the Western Cape students were even aware of the leak it would be a lot, an even smaller percentage of those would be aware of the paper's content. The "termination" of the chief invigilator's contract is without a doubt a desperate reaction by the WCED to save face. Surely the invigilator in question made an honest mistake? And a verbal warning to the Head of English at SACS? Hello?! What is this world coming to?
