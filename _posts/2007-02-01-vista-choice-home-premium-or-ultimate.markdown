So vista's been out and about for a couple of days and its time for me to make a decision about my Vista installation. The awful Home Basic is completely out of the question. Similarly Business and Enterprise are unneccesary and unavailable to me. So that leaves Home Premium and Ultimate.

From what I've read, choosing Home Premium over Ultimate will cause me to lose out on the following features:

  * Windows Domain logon
  * Windows Fax and Scan
  * BitLocker Encryption
  * Ultimate Extras (hmmm)

Is it really worth the cash for the Ultimate version? Help me out! Please! :)
