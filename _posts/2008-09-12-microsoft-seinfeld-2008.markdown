I'm still not entirely sure what my opinion on these adverts is. I like how Bill Gates' silly-side is expressed and exploited. Its funny seeing one of the richest men alive do the robot, but will it sell me Windows? Who knows.

**Notes on the Gates-Seinfeld cancellation**




On September 17, rumours spread that future "episodes" of Gates-Seinfeld had been cancelled for various reasons including "consumer confusion" and because they portrayed Microsoft as just "totally out of touch". These rumours were later squashed on September 18 when a trusted source of Gizmodo informed them that the ads were very certainly _**not**_ cancelled but rather that Microsoft had asked them to prioritize development of the "Anti-mac ads".




I for one, at the time of writing, am glad they will live on. I think its the most fun Microsoft have made of themselves in years!
