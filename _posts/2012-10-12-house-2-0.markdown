title: House 2.0
---

Signed, initialed, dotted and crossed: we've just bought our second house (and sold the first). The whole process has been daunting and - at times - terrifying but ultimately has been a great adventure. Lessons learned: banks are mostly terrible, good estate agents are a lifesaver, and lawyers cost a lot of money because they do really painful work on your behalf.

We've lived in our first home since we got married three years ago. It has been a great start for us. Compact, easy, manageable. We wanted to get into the property market from day one, and our little duplex townhouse gave us that. I wouldn't change anything.

House 2.0 has more rooms, more garden, a great kitchen, dining room and lounge. Its in a nearby neighbourhood and so we won't have to reconfigure our travel routines too much. I think we'll live there for several years.
