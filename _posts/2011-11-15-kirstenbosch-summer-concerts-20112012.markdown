They're back this year, and the line-up is looking good.

I've attended only a few summer concerts over my 24 years in Cape Town. Amy and I keep meaning to go, but end up forgetting. This year, we're going to change that.

There are 21 concerts starting this Saturday 20 November with Locnville & Jax Panik and ending with Hot Water & Wreslerish on 1 April 2012. Between those dates there are some fantastic acts including: The Parlotones (11 Dec), Zebra and Giraffe (26 Dec), Johnny Clegg (15 Jan), Goldfish (11 Mar), and Freshly Ground (18 Mar).
