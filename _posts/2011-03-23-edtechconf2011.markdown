[![](http://timk.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ETC2011-rect-224x300.png)](http://edtechconf.com)So, we're doing a conference. Its called **EdTechConf** and I'm really excited about it.

It's happening from 13-14 May in Cape Town, and 20-21 May in Worcester.

Join us for two days of input and discussion around questions such as:



	
  * Can we reach our pupils with technology in a way that doesnâ€™t wreck our budgets?

	
  * Is Social Media a teaching tool or a hindrance? 

	
  * Should we ban cellphones in our schools when almost all our pupils use them for communication and learning outside the classroom?

	
  * Can a research project mean more than a quick Google search? How can we teach digital literacy in ways which are cost-effective, meaningful and budget-friendly?

	
  * Is a computer lab needed in a 21st century school?

	
  * What are the pitfalls of using technology in the classroom?


This event is not to be missed. [Sign up now](http://www.edtechconf.com) and follow the conference team on [twitter](http://twitter.com/edtechconf). Do it.
