[TheNextWeb](http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2011/11/20/watch-steve-jobs-brainstorm-with-the-next-team-in-this-fascinating-video/) features a great YouTube find this morning - Steve Jobs and his team at Next on two of their early company retreats.

It's encouraging, especially as the co-founder of a [startup](http://mystaffroom.net), to see one of the truly great companies in tech history go through these difficult discussions and debates.
