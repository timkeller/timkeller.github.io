![China's Disney](http://www.japanprobe.com/2007/01/chinese-magic-kingdom.jpg)

Does the above photo look like Disneyland? Well its not, and this is no joke.

It emerged today that the Internet-filtering, democracy-hating government of _The People's Republic of China_ own a Disneyland-like theme park called The Shijingshan Amusement Park. That would be fine if it was Disney endorsed (which its not) or even if they actually admitted it to be a rip off of the real Disneyland (which they don't). They have renamed versions of Shrek, MickeyMouse, SnowWhite, and other famous copyrights of The Walt Disney Company.


> Extract from [The Standard](http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=20&art_id=41990&sid=13078355&con_type=1&d_str=20070411)...

With its slogan “Disneyland is too far,” Beijing’s Shijingshan Amusement Park features a replica of Cinderella’s Castle, with staff dressed like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and other Disney characters.

None of this is authorized by Disney - but that has not stopped the state-owned park from creating its own counterfeit version of the Magic Kingdom in a brazen example of the sort of open and widespread copyright piracy that has Washington fuming.

The United States announced Monday it would file a case at the World Trade Organization over rampant copyright piracy in China, a practice which US companies say deprives them of billions of dollars each year.

But 31-year-old housewife Zhang Li betrays a typical Chinese attitude on the issue while chasing her young son around the park.

“I don’t understand why that is such a big problem. Shouldn’t others be able to use those characters besides [Disney]?” she asks.


Sigh... what next China!

:P
