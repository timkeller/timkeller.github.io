I had the privilege of speaking at [SA Developer](http://sadeveloper.net) Cape Town last night. Twenty-something local geeks turned up to hear about how well the Open Source PHP language runs on Windows IIS, using FastCGI.

For the longest time, the utterance of "PHP" and "Windows" within the  same sentence meant the speaker was either temporarily insane, or  horribly misguided.

In 'An Oxymoron's Guide to PHP on Windows' you'll discover just how  much the situation has changed in the past 12 months. Thanks to Windows  Server, IIS7 and FastCGI, running PHP on Windows finally makes a great  deal of sense. It performs admirably and facilitates integration with  familiar Microsoft technologies like ASP.net and Silverlight.
