From time to time I have a problem getting the podcasts I'm subscribed to, to update. For example, a new MacBreakWeekly ([www.twit.tv/mbw](http://www.twit.tv/mbw)) was released last night yet my iTunes refused to notice it's existance all dayâ€¦ and this is not the first time I've experienced this issue.




After a little messing around I located the XML file which describes the podcast's RSS feed. It was on Leo Laporte's server at leoville.tv/podcasts/mbw.xml. I opened it in Firefox and noticed that the feed didn't have the new podcast in it either.




I decided to try and clear my browser cache for the page with a Cmd+Shift+R (something like Ctrl+F5 on Doze) and lo! and behold, iTunes started downloading the new podcast!




So, today's iTunes Podcasting tip is: "Clear you're damn Firefox cache!" :)
