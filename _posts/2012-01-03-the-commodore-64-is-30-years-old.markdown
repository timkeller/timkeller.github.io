[![](http://timkeller.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/640px-Commodore-64-Computer.png)](http://timkeller.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/640px-Commodore-64-Computer.png)This month marks exactly 30 years since the announcement of the [Commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) - the 8-bit home computer which outsold IBM PC-clones, Apple Computers and Atari's for much of the 1980's. It dominated with 35% market share from 1983 to 1986, eventually selling 17 million units, making it the first computer for "ordinary people".

The C64 featured a whopping 1Mhz CPU, 16Kb of RAM, and 16-colour TV display output. Input was via the built-in keyboard or plug-in joy-sticks. Storage was via an external floppy drive or tape recorder. The tape drive would take up to 30 minutes to load-in a game or programme.

Most notable, however, is that it popularised the use of modems for telecommunications between computers. America Online ([AOL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_Online)) started life as an online service for exclusively for Commodore owners called Quantum Link and offered email, chat, downloads and online games. In fact the original Dungeons & Dragons game, [Neverwinter Nights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverwinter_Nights_(AOL_game)), launched as an AOL game for the C64.

But, unfortunately, I never owned a one (though, it seems I still [could](http://www.commodoreusa.net/CUSA_C64.aspx)). Nor did I have access to the Internet until the late 90's. My first computer was a 286 PC-clone running DOS 5.0. For the first few years it only ran NewsMaster II and [WordPerfect 5.1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wordperfect-5.1-dos.png). After I learned a few DOS commands (and accidentally executed "rd C:/") an older friend installed several games. This introduced me to [Police Quest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Quest:_In_Pursuit_of_the_Death_Angel), [Space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest:_The_Sarien_Encounter) [Quest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_II:_Vohaul%27s_Revenge), [California Games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_games) and more. A few years later I upgraded to a 486 with a colour monitor before the Pentium era began.

It is amazing to think that the utterly gigantic and world-changing industry of personal computing is little more than 30 years old.

What was your first computer?
