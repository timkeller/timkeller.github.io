Yours truly, quoted in the Mail & Guardian. I was presenting at LEAP Schools on the phases of education technology implementation which I've [written about](/2012/07/19/technowledgey-notes/) before.

> He's outlined three broad phases of introducing technology to teachers and their classrooms.
>
> The first phase is creating a more visually dynamic learning classroom. "Students don't get what they don't see," he explains.
>
> Then, he believes teachers need to let students replace textbooks with electronic sources. "The output can remain traditional but they need digital devices like laptops or iPads to do research."
>
> Lastly, Keller suggests that teachers can focus more on building 21st Century skills which include critical thinking, collaboration and creation. "The student needs to be at the centre of the learning experience. This generation are not consumers of knowledge. They are producers."
