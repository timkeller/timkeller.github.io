![](http://www.leg.uct.ac.za/files/logo.png)If you're anything like me, you love trying out new Operating Systems. I use [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/) on my Mac for this, but you can use [VMWare Workstation](http://www.vmware.com/products/ws/) for the PC. Here at [UCT](http://www.uct.ac.za) we're blessed by having an awesome [Linux Enthusiasts Group](http://www.leg.uct.ac.za) (LEG) which run a huge (we're talking multiple TBs here) FTP server for everyone's use.




If you're on campus, or in the [Cape Town](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=cape+town&ie=UTF8&ll=-34.013965,18.573761&spn=0.311332,0.498505&t=h&z=11&iwloc=addr) area, you can take advantage of the massive speed-gain downloading from this server will bring. I'm on campus using the slow [Library](http://www.lib.uct.ac.za) Wifi to download Fedora9 at 1Mb/s. Find an ethernet port and you should get 6 or 7Mb/s. Not bad.




Here's just a taste of what is available






  * Linux Distro ISOs including Ubuntu, Fedore, SuSE, CentOS, Mandriva, Gentoo, DamnSmallLinux, Debian, and Slackware.


  * BSD ISOs including FreeBSD, NetBSD and others.


  * Distro Packages (Update your Distro locally - save time and bandwidth)


  * Random other stuff!




So head over the [[ftp://ftp.leg.uct.ac.za](ftp://ftp.leg.uct.ac.za)](ftp://ftp.leg.uct.ac.za) and have fun downloading.
