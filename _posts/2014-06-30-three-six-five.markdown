title: 365 days of photos
---

Tomorrow I'll take a photograph of something I see, import it into Lightroom, agonise over it for hours, export and upload it to a website. The following day I'll do the same thing. And the day after that.

And every day until 30 June 2015. Three hundred and sixty five photographs in as many days.

Why?

1. **Community.** My friends and colleagues at [Sunrise](//sunrise.co.za) undertook this challenge last year. [David](//thumpa.net) set up [a site](//threesixfive.co.za) and folks posted their work there. Many of them are redoing the challenge this year, and I feel like joining them.
2. **Practice.** I want to exercise the photograph-making muscle more regularly. Weeks can go by without my fairly nice camera [^1] being taken out its bag.
3. **Consistency.** [Dan Benjamin](//5by5.tv/people/dan) often remarks that the secret to success is showing up consistently and doing what you said you'll do. Well, outside of the most mundane of daily tasks, I can't think of anything I've done consistently for an entire year. This is a test to see if I can change that. 

I'm scared.

[^1]: I shoot a Canon 650D with a couple of entry-level Canon lenses. Current favourite is the EF 40mm f/2.8.
