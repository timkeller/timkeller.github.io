I'm not sure how dense I have become... but until a few months ago I was utterly oblivious to the existance of MySpace.com! Then, suddenly and sadly it is everywhere. I've had friends telling me I should get signed up to such a degree that tonight I caved and signed up. *Twi-light zone music plays*

Now granted these are first impressions and I haven't delved too deep but all I can say is it is the single most hideously designed service I have ever used. The site is littered with ugly banner and block adverts, the pages are poorly constructed, and you land up with the site creater - Tom - as your first friend... which just freaks me out because even his page is pretty ugly looking. Even the other services of this nature like LiveJournal (which I find tedious) are better... I really can't understand the excitement around this thing.

I have a little blog here and over at DeviantArt, and my friends can come comment if they want, and I dont carry millions of adverts. Sure I rent this server space but it hardly costs me a cent.

Am I like missing something that everybody else isn't? Hmmm... The internet never ceases to confuse me...
