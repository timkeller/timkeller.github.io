Ah my girlfriend [amy](http://www.amyblog.net) has got Sinusitis it seems. We went out last night to a braai at the minister's house but by 9pm she was *not* looking good so I took her home. She's just sleeping today but it's really sore. All the tubes and surrounds get inflamed and hurt.


> **From Wikipedia.org**
Sinusitis is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses from either bacterial, fungal, viral, allergic or autoimmune issues.

Therapeutic measures range from the medicinal to the traditional and may include simple analgesics (such as aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen), inhaling steam, nasal irrigation or jala neti using a warm saline solution, hot drinks including tea and chicken soup, over-the-counter decongestants, prescription nasal sprays, and getting plenty of rest. If sinusitis doesn't improve within 48 hours, or is causing significant pain, one should see a doctor, who may prescribe antibiotics or nasal steroids. If the recommended doses and duration of antibiotic treatment(s) are ineffective, one should reconsult a doctor; who may suggest further treatment by a specialist.


Hopefully she'll be better by Monday.
