In yet another hit for the rock-solid Debian, Linspire have [announced](http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/02/08/1830240&from=rss) that they will be using Ubuntu instead of Debian as the base for their Freespire 2.0 release in April. In exchange, Ubuntu users will get access to Linspire's successful CNR (click 'n run) application which delivers commercial linux software. Debian has gotta be feeling the tide of distro's moving away from its codebase...
