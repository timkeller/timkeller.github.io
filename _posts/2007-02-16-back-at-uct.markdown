[![UCT 16 February](http://timk.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/16022007.jpg)

So I'm back at UCT for my 2nd year in Computer Science and Psychology (with a bit of Maths on the side). It seems I have a pretty awesome schedule this year... especially with only 2 lectures on Mondays meaning I'll be home by 11am at the latest :)

The above is a photo from the bus stop this morning - the queue was MASSIVE and I arrived in Maths at 7:59am! Perhaps I need to rethink my parking spot.
Maths lecturer Kenny was as impressive as usual in his introduction to MAM1006H. Anyone who's ever been lectured by him will remember his "DON'T BE PASSIVE" speeches :) Patrick Marais was even more impressive in his introduction to Computer Science 2 at 9am. What a pleasure to finally have a highly organised and confident Course Co-ordinator. I think this is going to be a good year.

I have my first two Psychology lectures at 12 and 1pm later today - should be interesting. I'm taking Research in Psyc and Psychopathology (beware)!

Cheers
