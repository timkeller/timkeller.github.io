Still in the excited mood of getting word press up and running rather spectacularly - I got my girlfriend, amy, setup with one last night. She's going to be posting at www.amyblog.net from now on, so do drop by and see what she has to say once in a while.


Went for St. Elmos Pizza last night with her and the family - was very nice despite all but one of us having pizza (three of us went for subs). The waitress was, however, rather shocking. We ordered pita bread as a starter which arrived finally after waiting for 15 minutes. Then - just as we were ravenously tucking into the delicious pita in front of us... the main meal arrives! sigh... I dont believe this waitress has ever grasped the point of a *starter*...






Anyway, I've done some skin modifications to my blog this morning - I think they look pretty awesome. Time now to do 2 hours of that ComSci project before turning my attension to the dreaded Applied Mathematics (yuck)! I do feel that it might not be as bad as the image I have in my head - time will tell...
