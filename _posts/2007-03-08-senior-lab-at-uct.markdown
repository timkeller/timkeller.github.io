Just in case you were mildly interested... This is the right half of the Senior Unix Lab at UCT. Its on the top floor of the PD Hahn building which means either a 2-year wait for the 40 year old elevator, or a insanely tiring hike up a few thousand stairs!

Note the geeks (yes I'm one of them) enjoying Tetri-net via xterm ssh sessions! Ooooh!
