True Story: A man was driving through a really bad part of Cape Town last week - when suddenly his car broke down. He got out the car and went to inspect the engine. Caught up in the frenzy of traffic trying to divert around his stopped car he closed the driver's door behind him and heard the heart breaking click as he locked himself out. The keys were still in the car but all the doors had somehow locked.

He was a single man with no wife at home to bring him the spare set of keys and so quickly realised he had a major problem on his hands.

Thoughts of breaking the window of his car to get in were just begining to form in his mind when a random stranger pulled off the road and got out to help him. The two quickly realised there was no getting into the car and to the keys.

Just then the random stranger turned to the man and said: "Here, take my car and go fetch your spare key from home. I'll wait here and direct the traffic around your car." Astounded he took the 20 minute drive home and 20 minute drive back to the car and on return found the random stranger still directing traffic around his car.

When I heard this story I knew I had to blog it. Isn't it amazing: there actually are nice people left in the world... How cool! Have you got a "nice person" story?
