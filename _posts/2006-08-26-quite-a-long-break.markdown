Hi all,

So it looks like i've been missing in action for the past week or so. Tonight I figured it was time for a come-back. And what better way than with a shiny new theme. Its a little slower than the old one but graphically its stunning. Credits to the brilliant designer are at the bottom of the blog, I just edited it a little for personalisation and customisation.

So, this week has been really really busy for both Amy and I... and my next week is even more interesting. Amy's been finishing up her Teaching Prac's which she posted off today in one big parcel at a cost of R70. She had to include all the media she had made for the lessons, photographs of her board schemes, reports from the teacher marking her, and personal reflections on each item to name but a few. You can understand the stress and length of time in getting this together!

I wrote a CompSci test (got 74%), Maths Test, CompSci Practical Test, and Maths Mini-Test in the past three days. My next week is as follows:

Saturday: Finish CompSci Tutorial (due Mon), Do Psychology Essay (due Thursday). Edit SAPA DVD.

Sunday: Study Chapters 1 - 3 of Statistics for Test on Monday at 5pm. Submit CompSci Tutorial.

Monday: Hand in CompSci Tutorial, do Maths Workshop (2pm-4pm). Write Stats test (5pm - 6:30pm).

Tuesday: Work on Psychology Essay.

Wednesday: Finish Psychology Essay, Due Psychology Tutorial.

Interesting week hey? Quite sad when one starts using one's blog to plan out your week! hehehe.
:)
