Well I'm back at University after long weekend bliss. I've been off since last Wednesday afternoon (well, i had to come in briefly on Friday) and I must say its difficult to return to work after so much relaxation.

The day got somewhat annoying when this morning Luc informed me that there was a ComSci minitest in 4th period today! I confirmed it with a few other guys before checking the course website (some odd Sakai.org derivative called Vula). Shoved in little corner of the site was a message from Alex, the TA, saying Friday's cancelled mini-test had been moved to today... *mumble*

So here I am blogging when I should be revising... Hmmm... No. This is the problem with long weekends and the such - they totally stop you 'aving that "gosh I must work" feeling. Can't say i'm complaining... yet!
