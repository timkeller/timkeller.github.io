2010 saw Location Services rise to popularity, and it is clear that - aside from Tablets and Android phones - 2011 is going to be the year of Location-aware services.

I've been using Foursquare regularly for about a year. Foursquare is a service offering mobile applications for all major mobile platforms which allows you to "check-in" at a venue (like a mall, movie theatre, or restaurant). You can then optionally share this information with your 4SQ, Facebook, or Twitter friends.

Today, thanks to [SmarterWare](http://smarterware.org/7049/wheredoyougo-heatmaps-foursquare-check-ins), I discovered an interesting Foursquare+GoogleMaps mashup called [Where Do You Go](http://www.wheredoyougo.net/). It aggregates your last 12 months of check-ins into a stunning heatmap of your most "checked-into" places.

There's an increasing amount of concern around Location Privacy, and this service certainly gave me pause for thought. However the service doesn't pull data from the last 24-hours, and offers one button to delete all your cached data from their servers. Since its only building a heatmap based on my whereabouts over a long time, and since its already pretty clear that I live in Cape Town, I was willing to give it a try.

Furthermore, its an open source project with its [code](https://github.com/lehrblogger/where-do-you-go) hosted on github.

So, what does your heatmap look like? [Where Do You Go?](http://www.wheredoyougo.net)
