I needed to clear my statistics-filled mind yesterday evening, took a drive down to the beach and found this relic on a lonely strip of beach no one ever seems to go to... indeed I've lived in Kommetjie for 18 years and never gone to this beach before. Bit of an odd feeling standing totally alone on a beach...

Regards.
