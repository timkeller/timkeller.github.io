![Twit Podcasts](http://timk.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/twit.png)

I listen rather addictively to the TWiT Netcast (read Podcast) Network run by ex-TechTV host Leo Laporte and features regular panelists [John C. Dvorak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Dvorak), [Roger Chang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Chang), [Robert Heron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Heron_%28TechTV%29), [Patrick Norton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Norton), [David Prager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Prager), [Kevin Rose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rose), [Alex Lindsay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Lindsay), [Wil Harris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wil_Harris), and [Merlin Mann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_Mann).  TWiT (This Week in Technology) was started when the group got together at MacWorld 2005 and recorded a show called Revenge of the Screen Savers (Leo's TechTV show was called The Screen Savers). This developed into something much bigger and before long TWiT was born.

They now put out a plethora of completely free shows every week. If you haven't ever listened to these informative, educational, and just plain hysterical podcasts then toddle along to [www.TWiT.tv](http://www.twit.tv) and download the latest show.

I'd suggest you start your TWiT experience with these shows:
