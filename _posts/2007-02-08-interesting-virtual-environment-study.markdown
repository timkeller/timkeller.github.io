A PhD student in the Computer Science department at UCT (through which I'm completing a Computer Science major for my Bachelor of Science degree) is conducting an interesting postgraduate study and needs your help! It could earn you $100 of shopping at Amazon.com!

This data is being collected to assist in his research into the field of _Affective Scene Generation_, which is a technique he is researching that provides a novel interface to the generation of virtual environments. If you're interested in reading more about this, read through the [paper](http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/%7Echultqui/papers/asg_afrigraph_2006.pdf) he had published at Afrigraph in January 2006.

[Click here to participate](http://people.cs.uct.ac.za/~chultqui/experiment/) - it'll take just 5 minutes of your time!
