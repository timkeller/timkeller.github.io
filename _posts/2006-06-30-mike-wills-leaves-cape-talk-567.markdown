"The dogs have barked, but the caravan moves on" were the closing words of 567MW Morning Show host Mike Wills as I drove to work this morning. It's a sad day. I've been listening to Mike's morning show for years and am going to miss his flawless talent, genuine concern for humanity, and interest in bringing you the news as it happens.

Why exactly Primedia (parent company of 567 and 702) have chosen to remove Mike is beyond me. Mike stated that "It's simply a business decision, there's no conspiracy or politics going on here" [paraphrased], but in his farewall to Mike, funny-man Solly Philander joked that he wanted to read Mike a poem, but that he thought if he read "Three blind mice" that management would think he was referring to them. Rather witty on the surface - but it smacks of something more sinister happening behind the scenes.

I will drop in on the radio station from time to time, but the management at the station has lost a great deal of my respect. The least they could do would be to tell us the basis and reasoning behind their discussion. I wish Mike the very best for all his future endevours.
