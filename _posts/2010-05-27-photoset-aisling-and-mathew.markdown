In early 2010, I had the pleasure of photographing our good friends, Aisling and Mathew, shortly after their engagement.

Mathew was my Best Man and Aisling was Amy's bridesmaid at our wedding last December. We're delighted to be fulfilling the same roles whenÂ they tie the knot on 25 September 2010.
