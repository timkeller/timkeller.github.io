title: The future is computing not inevitable

In January 2010 Steve Jobs stood on a stage in San Francisco, and announced the iPad. I immediately called it a "giant iPod Touch" and discounted the notion of a "Post-PC era" as a marketing ploy. That is, until I held one. 

Was this device the next step of the evolutionary cycle that saw Mainframes become Mini-Computers and Desktop PC's become Laptops? Could I – a software developer – expect to be writing my next web application *on* this device? Would university students buy one of these instead of a laptop?

Shortly after the event, John Gruber explained the iPad [with an analogy](http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/various_ipad_thoughts):

> Used to be that to drive a car, you, the driver, needed to operate a clutch pedal and gear shifter and manually change gears for the transmission as you accelerated and decelerated. Then came the automatic transmission. With an automatic, the transmission is entirely abstracted away. The clutch is gone. To go faster, you just press harder on the gas pedal.

> That’s where Apple is taking computing. A car with an automatic transmission still shifts gears; the driver just doesn’t need to know about it. A computer running iPhone OS still has a hierarchical file system; the user just never sees it.

Great analogy – but does it hold up? A [blogger named Tom argues](http://unknowncoast.net/2012/08/2) that:

> The European car market demonstrates that the current popularity of automatic cars in the US was not inevitable; or at least, it wasn't an inevitable consequence of technological progress. It wasn't something that had to happen given the intrinsic technological properties of automatic cars. Under a different set of cultural and economic circumstances, manual transmission could have remained the dominant technology in the US, despite the availability of automatic cars.

The upshot of his argument is that the fabled and highly anticipated "iPad Mini" could present a hidden risk to Apple. If the device feels, even for a moment, like you couldn't use it as your only computing device, Apple loses.

> Does it make the iPad look more like an additional computer, or the only computer you'll ever need?

Read his entire post. Its insightful and most likely accurate. I expect Apple to market their smaller iPad as the "iPad Air". 

And I can not wait to buy one.
