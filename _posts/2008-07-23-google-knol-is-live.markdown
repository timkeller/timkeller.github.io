Yesterday, the big [G](http://www.google.com) released [Knol](http://knol.google.com) in beta form to the general public. Knol allows Google Account members to create "Knols" which are essentially a page about a topic. Thinking it sounds like Wikipedia? Well, some say that Knol is indeed a direct competitor to Wikipedia and Scholarpedia, others say its Google's first move away from **organising content on the internet** to truly **creating content**.




Knol presents an interesting difference from the Wiki platforms the occupy a large chunk of the internet today: there can and will be multiple Knols written by different people on the same topic. Thus, the notion of subjective opinion and author identity become vital to the system.




Add the Google Advertising platform to the product, and the promise of royalties being paid to Knol Writers, and you have the NextBigThing in my humble opinion. For the first time academics and authors will "compete" to have their Knol be the best and in turn pull the biggest audience.




Google just changed the world again.
