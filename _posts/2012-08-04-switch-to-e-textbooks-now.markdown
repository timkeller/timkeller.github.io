[Ivo Vegter](http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=56491) describes a solution to the textbook crisis:

> There's a simple solution to the problem. Just give every child an e-reader. Register it to their name, so they have a reason to be responsible with it, just as they are expected to be with their physical textbooks. This can be achieved for under R1 000 per child, and annual costs will go down if devices can be made to last a few years.

Yes.

> Here's a perfect opportunity for the private sector to make a massive difference to South Africa's future, invest in people they can actually employ one day, and make some money to boot.

Working on it.
