[![](http://timkeller.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Instapaper_4_logo_300-150x150.jpg)](http://timkeller.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Instapaper_4_logo_300.jpg)[David Smith](http://david-smith.org/blog/2011/11/16/a-punch-to-the-gut-always-hurts/) on Readbility and Instapaper:


> Today I find myself feeling deep sympathy and a fair bit of anger over what happened to [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com/) and its founder Marco Arment. Even though the series of events that lead to today has been in motion for months, today things seem to come to a head. Marco is far to much of a gentleman to call out the people who punched him, but it needs to be said.


In the beginning, there was a guy called Marco. Living and working in NYC as Lead Developer at Tumblr, he wanted a way to save the articles he found online, and read them on the subway to work.

The result was Instapaper - initially just a website but soon an iPhone app. In September 2010 he [left](http://techcrunch.com/2010/09/21/marco-arment-instapaper/) his full-time employment at Tumblr to focus on Instapaper. He has since put out two major releases of the app.

Sometime in between, the copycat apps started hitting the web and App Store. Today, Readability announced their's... and there's a story to be told:


> We figured out a way to work together: I’d build a white-label version of the Instapaper app that worked with the Readability service instead of mine, with no source-code sharing, and I’d get a royalty for each copy sold.

In February of this year, the app was finished and ready to launch, but it was rejected by Apple for the in-app-purchase subscription-matching rule, which had _just_ gone into effect. Readability decided that they didn’t want to give Apple the 30%, so the app was put on hold and soon cancelled once it was obvious that nobody was budging.


Marco seems to be staying calm [about](http://www.marco.org/2011/11/16/readability) it. I'd be annoyed. Yes, competition is healthy and moves our industry forward. But its [frustrating](http://timkeller.me/2011/09/16/innovation-to-imitation/) to see companies competing through imitation rather than innovation! Imitation lowers the tone of the entire category and makes it hard for truly high quality products to stick out.

So, let's talk about Marco and why I continue to choose his app:

1.
As Merlin Mann [writes](http://www.43folders.com/2010/02/05/first-care): "First, care. Care intensely." I don't know Marco personally, but have been an avid follower of his work on Tumblr, Instapaper and Build & Analyse for some time. Whether its the quality of his coffee, speed of his MacbookPro's fans, [choice of cereal](http://www.marco.org/2011/10/09/grape-nuts-vs-grape-nuts-flakes), type of [toaster oven](http://www.marco.org/2008/10/13/the-best-toaster-oven), or his iOS app - he cares.  Like, a lot.

2.
Marco isn't one of the pretentious VC-funded crowd. He's bootstrapped his way to success, taking no outside funding. He works for himself, by himself. This feedback loop has driven him to build the best business he can, because his livelihood is directly linked to its success. I'm sure that this is significant pressure for him to cope with... but it results in a great product for us.

3.
There's this small, privately owned Italian restaurant down the road from us. They're much smaller, and have to compete with plenty of large establishments in the area. But there are two reasons we choose them: First, they're authentic. Second, we have a relationship with the owner, Tino.

If we see him in the shops he'll stop and say hello. He's at his restaurant every night, and goes to great effort to make patrons feel comfortable and relaxed. There's a sense that we're not just his customers for the sake of extracting money from us, but rather that he genuinely cares about producing a great, personal, experience.

In many ways, Marco is like Tino. Through his writing and podcasting, he has established a relationship with his users. Through his honest business behaviour he's gained our trust. And through his meticulous app design, he's gained our support.


> This is a very big and increasingly crowded market, and there’s no reason why we can’t respectfully share it.


He's [right](http://www.marco.org/2011/11/16/readability). There is plenty of space for Readability, Evernote, Apple and Instapaper to all play in this market. But, Instapaper isn't Marco's final act. Its just the beginning.

For now, I guess the questions are_ what's next for Instapaper_ and _when will competitor's photocopiers begin?_

Instapaper, the best $4.99 you'll ever spend → [App Store](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=k1CkFsOh4nQ&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Finstapaper%252Fid288545208%253Fmt%253D8%253FpartnerId%253D30)
