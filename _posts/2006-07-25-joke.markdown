The phone bill was exceptionally high and the man of the
house called a family meeting.

**_Dad_:**  People this is unacceptable.  You have to limit the
use of the phone.  I do not use this phone, I use the one
at the office

**_Mum_:**  Same here, I hardly use this home telephone as I
use my work telephone

**_Maid_:** So what's the problem?  We all use our work telephones.
