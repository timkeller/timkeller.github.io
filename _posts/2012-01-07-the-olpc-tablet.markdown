[Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/5873942/the-100-olpc-tablet-is-really-real-and-debuting-at-ces) and [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/6/2688604/olpc-xo-3-0-tablet-a-8-inch-tablet-with-android-and-sugar-options-for) are reporting that the OLPC XO 3.0 tablet will be shown off at CES next week. What's more, it is expected to go into production very shortly and apparently reach the market at a cost of $100. This is impressive considering the specs:



	
  * 8-inch, 1024x768, PixelQi display

	
  * Marvell Armada PXA618 processor

	
  * 512Mb RAM

	
  * Android or Linux Sugar Operating System

	
  * Rugged case and soft-rubber cover


OLPC has noted that the $100 model won't include the expensive PixelQi display but instead has a normal LCD.
