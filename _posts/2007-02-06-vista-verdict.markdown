I've been running Vista ultimate for the past 4 days on my two year old P4 3.0ghz machine with 1024mb DRR400 RAM and I must say I'm mostly very happy. Under load it slows down a bit and there's definitely more overhead than XP ever had - but that is to be expected. We're dealing with an OS designed to run flawlessly on todays very latest hardware. I think this is necessary in order to keep it relevant through 2012 at which date standard support ends. I'm going to go ahead and buy new Dual Core CPU and 2 gigs of DDR2-800 ram soon. That should bring things up to speed... literally.
