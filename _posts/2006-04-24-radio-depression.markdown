As a person with some poltical and business interested I listen to Cape Talk 567Mw (www.capetalk.co.za) to get my fix of the daily news, views and information regarding basically everything to do with my city and the world. I enjoy the station because it presents really current and interesting stories without the popular culture rubbish that fills most other morning shows on other stations. Sadly, that has come to an aburpt end- here's why.

On Easter Sunday one of SOuth Africa's most up and coming young actors, and star of the hit MTV advert series and movie Crazy Monkey, Brett Goldin and best friend Johnathan Blomm, was shot dead by armed gangsters in an armed robbery in Athlone, Cape Town, SA. I dont recall since Diana's death feeling such an outpuring of sympathy and upset at such a horrible happening. I got into my car on the Tuesday after easter and turned on Cape Talk to catch up and was greeted by Mike Wills saying: "Morning Cape Town - It is indeed a very grim day today". He proceeded to explain the awful events that had taken place that weekend in brutal detail. I had seen the report on TV and was concerned - but somehow when its a normally lively Radio Personality telling you the story it hits home more vividly!

That was Tuesday. Wednesday morning gave me the same greeting- "It is a sad time to be Capetonian". By Thursday I was begining to feel horrinly depressed by all the negative discussion in every corner of the media, dinner table and television news bulletins. Friday morning was even worse, because it was a "Lets sum up just how bad this week has been" show. After 15 minutes of it I decided I was over being depressed by the radio. I flicked onto 5Fm and listened to the utterly annoying but rather funny Mark Gillman.

Its odd how a Radio Station can depress one... if your radio's depressing you: turn it off!

Regards
