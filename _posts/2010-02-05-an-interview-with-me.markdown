The Website Team at Umoya tend to interview one of the staff every couple of weeks, this week was [my turn](http://www.umoya.net/site/blog/25).


> **It is time we took up the mic again and interrogated some of the team here.  Today, we decided to pick on: Tim Keller : Lead Developer and general software guru**.

[Ed] Tim, you've been with a Umoya for a few years now, how did you get to be working here?

[Tim] I got to know Peter through Sunvalley school, he became aware I needed financial assistance to complete my university studies, took a risk and offered to fund me in return for me coming to work at Umoya.

[Ed] Are you Cape Town born and bred?

[Tim] I am indeed.  I've lived in the same house all my life (until just recently).

[Ed] Ah yes, you've just given up bachelorhood I believe - congratulations!

[Ed] I gather your dad is head of Sunvalley Primary, is your mom also a teacher?

[Tim] My family: Teachers, Teachers and more Teachers

[Ed] I sympathise â€“ my siblings were also all teachers.

[Ed] Have you always wanted to be a software developer?

[Tim] No, as a kid I wanted to be a .... wait for it - Teacher!  Then of course an Astronaut, Computer Engineer, then Lawyer.... the list goes on.

[Ed] Where did you study?

[Tim] The great UCT!

[Ed] [what is it about UCT students?!  Humble as anything.]

[Ed] So was it straight from school to varsity to Umoya?

[Tim] Not quite.  I've worked as: a teacher, video editor, sound engineer, and web designer.

[Ed] What are some of the things you love

[Tim] My wife (hopeless romantic I know) [Ed: don't worry, you'll get over it], Apple Macs [Ed: terrible fanboy!], photography, formula1, gadgets and (good) music.

[Ed] What do you hate?

[Tim] Hating things.

[Ed] o...k... moving right along...

[Ed] Your role in Umoya?

[Tim] Lead Developer and Systems guy for staffroom.  I created staffroom in response to my dad's frustrations with school admin, and it is now looking like being something that could gain some substantial usage in South African schools.  It helped immensely to have Umoya take staffroom under their wing.

[Ed] You're known in Umoya as...?

[Tim] Pink shirt guy.

[Ed] If you were a wild animal, what would you be?

[Tim] Meerkat (pokes head up every now and then to see the bigger picture)

[Ed] A meerkat in a pink shirt?  I'm going to let that one slide right by or the conversation might turn weird!
