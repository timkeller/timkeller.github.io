> There is a nasty micropolitics of schooling at play here. It is common knowledge that schools, under tremendous political pressure to improve their pass rates, do two things.

They hold pupils back in earlier grades, especially Grade 11; and they downgrade pupils into easier subjects, such as mathematical literacy over pure mathematics.

In other words, the greater the chances of pupils in Grade 12 passing, the better the school looks, the better the province looks, the better the country’s averages look.

The department acknowledges what it calls “culling”.


Pause for a moment and just think about that.

This is (partly) how our education system lost 539 102 learners between enrolling in Grade One in 2000 and now.
