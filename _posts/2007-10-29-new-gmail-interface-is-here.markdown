The interface on my gmail account is clearly new and revised. Its not earth shattering, or even earth-trembling... but its something.

New features found:
- Ability to Attach an Event Invitation
- Revised Gtalk Gadget
- Prefetching of messages so there is no waiting when you click to open an email.
- AMAZING new contacts manager
- "Old Version" button
- "Loading box" is now yellow and centered
- Initial Loading screen now features an Arial "Loading..." rather than Times New Roman
