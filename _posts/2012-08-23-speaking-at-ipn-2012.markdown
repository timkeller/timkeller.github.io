I'm delighted to be speaking at the International Education Business Partnership Network's 2012 conference. Its running from 25 - 28 September at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban.

From the conference [website](http://www.ipnconference2012.org):

> Rising youth unemployment, gender stereotyping and low up-take of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) subjects are just some of the global challenges facing countries across the world. With both Europe and America facing increasing economic dilemmas, problems such as unemployment and job creation are no longer confined to the developing world.The conference will bring together developed and developing countries to address the all important transition from learning to earning, crucial for global economic prosperity.

[Registration](http://www.ipnconference2012.org/site/register) is still open and, with a NASA Astronaut among the speaker line-up, looks well worth attending.
