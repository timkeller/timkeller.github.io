Ice Cream Sandwich, the 4th major version of Android, was announced at Google IO in May 2011. A month ago, on November 14th, Google completed development and released the source code.

Sony Ericsson [explains](http://developer.sonyericsson.com/wp/2011/12/07/ice-cream-sandwich-from-source-code-release-to-software-upgrade/) why customers shouldn't expect them to ready with an ICS update any time soon:


> Many operators also want to customise the software according to their requirements, which in turn are based on their market, network, differentiation and business model. We implement all of these customisations and create a variety of software packages and releases for each operator.


This is just insane. It'll be months before anyone sees ICS updates on their phones.

Sony Ericsson goes to great lengths to explain that they also need to replace the default Android "graphics" with their own. Why bother?

My wife got received a Galaxy Ace on her contract upgrade but was given a Nexus S by a friend. These phones are both made by Samsung. The Nexus S is an "Google-experience phone" which runs a unadulterated build of Android.  The Ace, however, is loaded to the brim with Samsung's silly "TouchWiz" UI and bloatware applications.

The result is a sub-standard Android experience on non-Google phones. It lowers the tone of the entire platform, and reduces its attractiveness to developers.

This is the fundamental difference in approach between Apple's iOS and Google's Android.  Apple doesn't care about carriers and what they want. Android handset makers survive at the mercy of the carriers.
