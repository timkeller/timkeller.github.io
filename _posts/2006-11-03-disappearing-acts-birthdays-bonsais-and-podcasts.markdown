Hey all, phew what a semester! Totally insane in every way! I'm back, and it feels good - lets see...

Right. First of all - Happy Birthday to me for 10/31. Thanks to all of ya who text'd, phone'd, and IM'd me - I think I got more text's this year than ever before, awesome. It was my first girlfriend'd birthday and Amy got me loads of awesome goodies - she's very nice (Check out her dA if you have a chance at www.solpalapody.deviantart.com). Its her birthday on 8 November! I gotta sort out her pressie this weekend!

Yesterday the two of us set off on a bit of a shopping trip into the northern suburbs and found the Olive Grove Bonsai Center. Bonsai is something I've been totally amazed by for most of my life and since about April this year, actively involved in. I bought a 8 year old Pyracantha which is presently in flower with beautiful white petals. These will die towards winter (southern hemisphere remember) and become Yellow Berries... I cant wait :) Its a great hobby.

I've also discovered the joys of the TWiT.tv podcast network. If you're a geeky type and not listening to one of their podcasts, you're really missing out. Its brilliant, and home to some of the net's best podcasters.

I'm writing exams until 17th November so will be at home and blogging - I look forward to getting back into this blogging thing!
