We had two consultants from [The Institute](http://www.inst.net) in the Umoya Offices this morning to begin taking us through the [LEMON Leadership](http://www.inst.net/lemon_leadership.html) course. It was extremely informative, and inspirational.




It basically defines you as a leader within two of the following categories: Luminaries, Entrepreneurs, Managers, Organizers, and Networkers (hence LEMON).




My initial impression was that I was primarily a Luminary (thinking, consideration, idea focused, head-in-the-cloudsish) and secondaryily Entrepreneurial. I'm anxiously awaiting the results of the survey we filled in to see what if my guess was right!
