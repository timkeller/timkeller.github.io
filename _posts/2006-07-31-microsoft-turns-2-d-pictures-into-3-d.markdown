Beta News reports:





> Microsoft has released a technology preview of a application it calls "Photosynth," which has the capability to turn two-dimensional images into three-dimensional landscapes. The program does this by analyzing several different images of the same object, and then reconstructing it in 3-D. The user would be able to virtually "walk" or "fly" through this space, Microsoft says.

[Photosynth](http://labs.live.com/photosynth/blogs/) is slated to be demonstrated at the Siggraph 2006 computer graphics conference in Boston on Wednesday. Photosynth was born out of Microsoft's Live Labs, a group of scientists and engineers that are studying new ways to use the Internet. The group was founded in February 2006 by Dr. Gary Flake, who joined MSN as a distinguished engineer in April of last year.
