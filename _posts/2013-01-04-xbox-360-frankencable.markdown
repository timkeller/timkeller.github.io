I finally got an XBox 360 [^1] this year. I've never been a serious console gamer but the slow demise of my [beloved](/2010/10/08/learn-unlearn-relearn/) World of Warcraft and a promotional price convinced me to indulge a little. Turns out I really like it - thanks in no small part to the incredible Halo 4.

For most of its life, its been plugged into the HD TV in the living room. This approach works well – I get to play games from the couch, and my wife and I both get to enjoy its excellent media centre features. 

However coming from the PC world, the couch-based gaming experience never quite felt right. I'm acustomed to playing from an upright chair with my nose 50cm away from the computer monitor. I needed to move the console upstairs to my study. There was just one problem: my Samsung monitor supports HDMI, but has neither internal speakers nor an audio-out port. So the HDMI audio is sent to my screen and promptly ignored.

The XBox 360 offers two ports for audio and video output – standard HDMI and some proprietary interface labeled "AV". This analogue port is used with the (included) [Microsoft XBox 360 AV Cable](http://www.gamesx.com/avpinouts/xbox.htm) to provide old-school (Yellow, Red, Black) RCA connectors for older televisions. But this still wasn't what I needed: HDMI video and analogue stereo audio. Even worse, the plastic connector at the end Microsoft's AV Cable is built such it blocks the HDMI port when plugged in. 

Fortunately, the Internet seemed to think that the XBox would not disable the HDMI port when the AV cable was plugged in. So the solution was fairly simple: a) break the plastic AV cable connector so that both it and the HDMI cable can be plugged in simultaneously, and b) create _The Frankencable_ to combine the two RCA audio cables into a single female 3.5mm mini-jack. This would allow the use of iPod earphones, analogue headphones, or my Logitech speakers with the XBox.

## Here's your shopping list:

1. A stereo RCA cable [^2]
2. An RCA-to-RCA joiner for both the Left and Right cables.
3. If, like me, you'd like to have the option of plugging in your headphones (or iPod earphones) you'll want to pick up a 3.5mm mini-jack Male to Female cable. These come in various lengths. Just make sure it supports stereo.
4. Solder
5. Insulation tape

## Instructions:

1. Take a hacksaw (or Dremel tool) to the AV cable connector. The protruding bit that blocks the HDMI port is made of fairly thin plastic and is easy removed.
2. The ports are very close together on the XBox. Try to create a bit of extra space for the HDMI connector on the AV connector.
3. Many HDMI cables have squishy plastic connectors that make them much larger (vertically) than neccesary. Take a sharp knife to the HDMI connector so that its not much thicker/taller than the metal part.
4. Time to work on the audio cables. Put the XBox AV cable away so you're not confused by RCA ports.
5. Take your stereo RCA cable, cut off one set of of the RCA connectors and strip the cable. You'll find an inner copper core surrounded by an outer sheeth. 
6. Wind the two outer sheeths together to form one copper wire. This will be our new "common wire". You'll be left with it and the two inner cores. One of those inner cores should be Red. Fortunately, in the RCA standard, Red is always Right.
7. Next take the male-to-female 3.5mm mini-jack cable and cut it. Carefully strip the cable connected to the female side. Stereo cables will contain three wires: Left, Right and a common wire [^3].
8. Now its time to join the cables. Red is always Right, so join the RCA Red wire to the mini-jack Red wire. Then join the other RCA inner-core (Left) to what you discern to be the Left wire on the mini-jack. Finally, join both RCA's outer sheeths to the mini-jack's common wire.
9. Insolate the wires ahead of giving it a test.
10. Plug in both the HDMI and AV connectors to the XBox. Use your RCA joiner to connect the AV cable to your Frankencable, and plug your earphones/headphones into the mini-jack's female connector.
11. You should get a good audio signal [^4]. If you're not getting any sound, swap your Left and Common wires and test again.

Once you're happy with the sound, unplug and firm up your wire joins. Insulate well with electrical tape, and enjoy your Frankencable!


[^1]: My particular model is the [XBox 360 S 4Gb edition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_360_retail_configurations#Xbox_360_S_4.C2.A0GB_model). I added the drop-in 320Gb Hard Drive when Halo 4 was released. 

[^2]: Typically this will be a tearable cable with Red/Black or Red/White connectors on the end.

[^3]: The common will often be a thinner wire, positioned between or on top of the Left and Right wires. 

[^4]: I get a very, very soft buzz while in the XBox 360 Dashboard. Oddly, this disappears as soon as I launch a game.
