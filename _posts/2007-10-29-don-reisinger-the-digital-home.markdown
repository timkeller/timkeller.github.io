Greetings kind readers,

I'm on study leave this week as I prepare to write what I predict will be the final Mathematics (Calculus) exam of my life, the next Computer Science exam of my life, and the similarly next Psychology exam I must write in order to inch closer to my eventual Bachelor of Science.

I can't recall the last time I typed 'www.cnet.com' into my browser's (Firefox 3-Alpha9-Nightly, by the way) address bar - and yet I seem to be finding my way over there increasingly often via Digg, Reddit and other links. Anyway, my point is there is a blog called [The Digital Home](http://blogs.cnet.com/8300-13506_1-17.html) by a freelance tech journalist named Don Reisinger whom you may recognise as a (now fairly regular) TWiT.tv panelist which keeps appearing in the most popular section on the website - and it most certainly worth your subscribing to his RSS feed.

Don's just published a piece on why [Leopard will open the Mac OS X floodgates (and embarrass Microsoft)](http://blogs.cnet.com/8301-13506_1-9806255-17.html?tag=head) which is not only well written, but very insightful.

Word on the street is that Apple will be releasing a new range of MacBook laptops soon (like really soon). If such an event comes to pass I will be deeply, deeply tempted to make a purchase.

**Kinda important or cool things on the web at the moment**
