Once in a while I disappear for extended amounts of time and wait until someone notices I've stopped blogging - then, encouraged by the fact that someone actually wants to read about me, I create a new post referring to my return to blogging. We're living in a MySpaceFaceBook world these days, I'm glad this blog is seperate from all that.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still trying to convert every single MySpace.com user I can get my hands on, but sometimes logging in and being told that "Steven has joined the group: If 10 000 join this group I'll cycle the 2008 Argus Cycle Tour naked" is perhaps a tad much after a long day. Anyway, I'm rambling!

Let me start by posting a link to [www.jubileestudios.com](http://www.jubileestudios.com). This is the portfolio of Josh Staub, a truly brilliant and multi-talented artist who works at Cyan Worlds in Spokane USA. He's done concept for the Myst and Uru games, take a look at his Cyan portfolio on the above mentioned site - wow!

Next I must say a gigantic **w00t** is in order. I have almost single-handedly finished and sold my first Web Application, Chirp Assess based upon my custom-written Chirp PHP Framework (CPF). Chirp Assess is a complete modular school administration suite, allowing features such as Student Management, Assessment/Marks Capture, Report creation and printing, Inventory Control, Messenging, and SMS services. It runs on a Web Server and is accessible both inside and outside of the school, allowing teachers with Internet Access the ability to work on it from home. Anyway, it went live about two weeks ago on the client's servers and has been very stable with only two small patches being neccesary to fix silly little bugs.

Finally I can't wrap up this post without a rant about how much work I currently have :) This Friday I have a Computer Science test on such topics as Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Hashing, Priority Queues, and Graph Theory. The weekend will see me completing this weeks Computer tutorial on Hashing and preparing for the Closed Practical (apparently scheduled for this week) as well as studying for a major Psychology test on Monday eve! If you don't see me, you know why!

Thanks for reading!

Timo
