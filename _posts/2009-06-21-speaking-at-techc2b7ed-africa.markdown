I've been asked to speak at Microsoft's [TechEd Africa](http://www.tech-ed.co.za) from 2-5 August. Around 2000 IT pros and developers will assemble at the Durban ICC to hear about some of the latest technologies in the tech space.

As with Microsoft DevDays earlier this year, I'll be keeping Microsoft honest with two Open Source sessions:



	
  * Windows Server & FastCGI technologies for PHP

	
  * Embrace Open Source on [Codeplex](http://www.codeplex.com)


Some vital links

	
  * [Agenda](http://tech-ed.co.za/agenda.aspx)

	
  * [Register](http://tech-ed.co.za/registration-info.aspx)


Hope to see some of you there!
