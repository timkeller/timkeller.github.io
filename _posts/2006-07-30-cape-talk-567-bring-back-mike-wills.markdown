Since I posted my news piece about Mike Wills leaving Cape Talk 567 I have received numerous comments and messages agreeing that he should not have been fired, asked-to-leave, or whatever term you may want to apply to the situation which saw Mike's contract not being renewed for another year.

I believed him to be the finest host that Cape Talk had to offer and know that Cape Talk has definitely lost a lot of listeners because of their decision. I have not yet found out what Mike is up to these days, I really hope he's doing well... I do know that my mornings are somewhat incomplete.

Comments on this blog have included:


> _I agree - my mornings just havent been the same since Mike left. And as much as Ive been trying to give Aiden Thomas the benefit of the doubt, I just dont enjoy the morning show as much as I used to. I wish Cape Talk had been a bit more open about their reasons for not renewing Mikes contract. I guess the only logical explanation is that the decision was BEE based. Whatever. At the end of the day, Cape Talk has definitely let one of the better guys go _

_Mike Wills was the main reason I lisened to Cape Talk. I now listen mainly to SAFM, but still switch stations looking for someone like Mike._

_Really sad to see Mike gone. It was great to wake up to someone who sounds like just a regular guy, but is really passionate about what he does and what he believes in. Agree, could only have been a BEE decision. The poor fellow they have in his place now brings up frightening memories of Frasier Cranes colleague Gil, the way he unmelodiously sings his message across. Primedia, do what you have to do, but the day John Maytham leaves youll lose a sizable portion of your thinking audience. _

_Really miss Mike in the mornings. I have also stopped listening to Cape Talk in the mornings now that mike is gone. Do still listen to John in the evenings though. _


These comments are all from people I dont know and that have somehow found my blog while Googling or the similar. If these people can find me there must be hundreds of others also missing Mike. The question is, what can we do about it?
