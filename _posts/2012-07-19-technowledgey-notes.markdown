I had the pleasure of presenting a new talk at [Future-Ed 2012](http://future-ed.co.za) last week. The talk was entitled "Techknowledgey" and tried to unpack a model for The Future Classroom.

## Technology Implementation Continuum

Prof. Penturan's Technology Implementation Continuum defines four stages:

* Substitution – Technology acts as a direct tool substitute, with no functional change.
* Augmentation – Technology acts as a direct tool substitute, with a [functional](http://youtube.com) [improvement](http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/).
* Modification – Technology allows for [significant](http://earth.google.com) [task redesign](http://khanacademy.org).
* Redefinition – Technology enables the creation of new tasks, previously inconceivable.

## Student as Producer

![](/assets/2012-07-19-techknowledgey-notes/phase3model.png)

We've got to evolve the role of "student". Presently, students are passive consumers of incoming teaching. Let's set them up in a couple of different roles:

* Producer – Our students are capable of producing *things* that have value.
* Publisher - Web 2.0-style services allow students to submit their work to the world.
* Audience - Students have an audience of more than just their teacher; they expose their production to the class and world.
* Reviewer - In this role students enter a peer-review stage. By providing constructive critism to their peers, and integrating this feedback into their own work, we start this process again.
