Oh wow its been too long and so much has transpired in the month and a half since I've last blogged. My apologies for this, life took on a new meaning for busy during late may and early june with the advent of University exams amoungst others. But i'm here, I'm back, and ready to blog myself into Oblivion (which by the way I'm told is a game I need to play over this winter)...

Right so a new theme on my blog to mark the begining of a new era. I've also rearranged my room somewhat so that I have dual monitors again (yay). Likewise I've subscribed on Deviant Art and have put up a ton of great new deviations this weekend.

**The Out Series**

And there are two more in that series which I'll blog another time due to space restrictions.

Something thats pretty exciting is that I've finally got DSL internet at home! Its taken years but I've finally bit the bullet, so to speak, and give money to the dear and ever popular Telkom to provide me with a DSL line. Its great to be able to Skype and Webcam and exceed your cap and that sorta thing! Hehe.

I've been teaching two courses at SMA (SilvermineAcademy.co.za) - Web Design to Grade 8s and Java Programming to Grade 9s - and I must say that if I wasn't going into the IT industry I could easily find comfort in the teaching profession. There is something very satisfactory about teaching kids that are just hanging on your every word 'cause they're desperate to hear what you have to say. Pretty cool. I know a bunch of my students read my blog... so thanks guys - you make it fun :)

Other than that... I promise to try harder to blog every day or two from now on. Its holiday and Amy and I plan on sorting our Blogs out... We seem to do that each holiday. Hehe. Hope all you readers are doing well.

Cheers,

Tim
