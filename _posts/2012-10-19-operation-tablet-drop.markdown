The Financial Times reporting on Nicholas Negroponte's and Matt Keller's (no relation, as far as I know) latest experiment:

>Six months ago, they dropped dozens of boxed tablets into two extremely remote villages in Ethiopia, where the population was completely illiterate, dirt poor and had no prior exposure to electronics. They did not leave any instructions, aside from telling the village elders that the tablets were designed for kids aged four to 11. 

And guess what happened?

>In both villages, activity coalesced around a couple of child leaders, who made the mental leap to explore those tablets â€“ and taught the others what to do.

This supports [Prof Sugata Mitra's](http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education.html) thesis on child-driven learning as a self-organising system. In particular, according to his biography on TED.com:

>Sugata Mitra's "Hole in the Wall" experiments have shown that, in the absence of supervision or formal teaching, children can teach themselves and each other, if they're motivated by curiosity and peer interest.

We need more of this research. Why is it that regardless of how remote children are, or how illiterate their community, they have the ability to figure out seemingly complex systems? Its as if children are born with a [technology acquisition device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_acquisition_device) that let's them adapt to using new tools.
