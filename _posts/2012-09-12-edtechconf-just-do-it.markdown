I'm speaking at the EdTechConf ThinkShop this friday. The afternoon's topic is "Just do I.T." and will focus on practical technologies for teachers. 
My session is all about Open Source tools for learning. I'm talking about [Edubuntu](http://edubuntu.org), [Open Sankore](http://open-sankore.org), [RaspberryPi](http://www.raspberrypi.org), [Android](http://source.android.com), and more. I'll also touch on Open Education Resources from the [Khan Academy](http://khanacademy.org), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), and [Siyavula](http://www.siyavula.com).
