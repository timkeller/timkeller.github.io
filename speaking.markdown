Tim presents on several topics around the intersection of technology and education. Here of some of them. Please [get in touch](/contact) if you'd like to hire him.

## <a id="edtechrev"></a>The EdTech Revolution

Its not hard to miss. Everywhere you look people are talking about it: Open learning, online instruction, tablet-equiped classrooms and eTextbooks are taking the world by storm.

How did we get here? Where are we going? And how on earth do we deliver awesome teaching and learning in the midst of the biggest revolution that education has ever seen?


## <a id="futureclassroom"></a>The Future Classroom

In "The Future Classroom" we look at the past, present, and future of learning. We start 200 years ago in the Victorian era of education, evaluate the present reality, and conclude with a framework for the next century of schooling.

Open Education Resources such as the Khan Academy, MITx and iTunes U, are changing the way that the people across the world learn. However in Southern Africa, rural internet penetration is so poor that the digital-divide is quickly becoming a knowledge-divide. What does this mean for teachers and school leadership... and how do we address it? How do we establish a strategy for the future of learning? How do we stop teaching technology, and start using the technology to teach?


## <a id="cyberparenting"></a>Smart Cyber-Parenting

Did you know that a recent survey found that at least half of all teens say their parents have absolutely no clue as to what they do online?

Tim will help you to understand the significant digital generation divide that makes parenting in this 21st century so challenging. Learn more about the rise of "Social Media" over the past five years, and how it is actively shaping our childrenâ€™s social interactions. He will examine some "online dangers" and provide you with simple, sensible action steps to help protect yourselves and your children against these risks. Followed by an open floor Q & A session.


## Other talks

Tim has presented several other talks including:
- Techknowledgy: Implementing The Future Classroom
- Learning to Surf: The Social Media Tsunami

## Feedback

Somerset House, Somerset West:

> We have received awesome feedback regarding your talk last night, from staff and parents.  It was thought-provoking, challenging and very, very helpful. Your manner of presentation was perfect for what we needed to achieve and I think you have helped position our school very well for where we are headed.  I appreciated the thought and preparation that was put into your presentation enormously and I would recommend that every school should be exposed to a presentation of this nature.  It was brilliant.
